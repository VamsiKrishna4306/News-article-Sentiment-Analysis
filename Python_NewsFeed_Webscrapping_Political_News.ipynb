      "House Democrats on Tuesday released excerpts of the transcripts of their closed-door depositions with former US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n",
      "Tue, 05 Nov 2019 20:24:23 GMT\n",
      " (CNN)In a significant reversal, a top us diplomat has changed his testimony Monday to the impeachment inquiry to now admit there was a quid pro quo linking US aid to Ukraine with an investigation into President Donald Trump's political rival.\n",
      "Attorney for US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's sent the committee a three-page addition to his testimony on Monday, in which Sondland said he had remembered a September 1 conversation that occurred on the sidelines of a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he told a top aide to Zelensky that the security aid and investigations were linked.\n",
      "\"I now recall speaking individually with Mr. (Andriy) Yermak, where I said resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\" Sondland said.\n",
      "Sondland's new testimony, which was included in the public release of his closed-door deposition transcript on Tuesday, adds to Democrats' evidence that the President connected the freezing of US security aid to Ukraine to investigations into the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden, which cuts to the heart of their impeachment case against Trump.\n",
      "The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees released deposition transcripts of Sondland and former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker on Tuesday as they shifted toward the public phase of their impeachment inquiry.\n",
      "In his deposition last month, Sondland testified that he did not ultimately know why the aid to Ukraine was withheld. But he told lawmakers that efforts from the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to persuade Ukraine to open an investigation into Trump's political rivals \"kept getting more insidious\" as time went on, and he suggested Giuliani's efforts might have been illegal, according to the deposition transcript.\n",
      "Sondland testified that it would be \"improper\" for Giuliani to push the Ukrainians to investigate Biden or get involved in the 2020 election. Asked if it was illegal, Sondland said: \"I'm not a lawyer, but I assume so.\"\n",
      "In his testimony, Volker said that the Ukrainians had asked to be put in touch with Giuliani — whose efforts have been described by other witnesses as a shadow foreign policy outside of State Department channels — because they believed \"that information flow would reach the President.\" He said he was surprised and troubled by what was said on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n",
      "\"It creates a problem again where all of the things that we're trying to do to advance the bilateral relationship, strengthen our support for Ukraine, strengthen the positioning against Russia is now getting sucked into a domestic political debate in the U.S., domestic political narrative that overshadows that. And I think that is extremely unfortunate for our policy with Ukraine,\" Volker said.\n",
      "Still, Volker's testimony also provided Trump and his allies with fodder, as they've been pushing for it to be released publicly. Volker told lawmakers that he didn't know about any \"quid pro quo\" linking US military assistance to the announcement of Ukrainian investigations into Biden and the Democrats.\n",
      " \"You asked what conversations did I have about that quid pro quo, et cetera,\" Volker said. \"None, because I didn't know that there was a quid pro quo.\"\n",
      " He testified that after learning about the holdup of US military aid, Volker worked to get the assistance resumed, and that he never believed it was linked to Trump's desire for a probe of the Bidens.\n",
      "Volker also said that the Ukrainians didn't know about the holdup of military assistance until after the Trump administration stopped pressing them to announce an investigation into the Bidens. This testimony bolsters a key tenet of Trump's defense -- that there was no \"quid pro quo\" with Ukraine because the new government in Kiev was not aware that military aid was being withheld.\n",
      "\"To my knowledge, the news about a hold on security assistance did not get into Ukrainian Government circles, as indicated to me by the current foreign minister, then diplomatic adviser, until the end of August,\" Volker said. \"And by the time that we had that, we had dropped the idea of even looking at a statement.\"\n",
      "But Volker appeared to be unaware that on September 1, Sondland told Zelensky's political aide that the security aid and the announcement of a public investigation were in fact linked.\n",
      "House Democrats have now released transcripts from four of the 13 closed-door deposition they've conducted thus far as Democrats shift toward public hearings in the impeachment inquiry, which could begin as soon as next week.\n",
      "Volker and Sondland, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, dubbed themselves the \"three amigos\" who handled US-Ukraine policy. Text messages provided to Congress from Volker, who resigned last month from his post as the Ukraine scandal was unfolding, show his exchanges with Giuliani and senior State Department diplomats. He denied participating in any effort to dig up political dirt on Biden, but the texts revealed that he had talked to Ukrainian officials about launching politically charged investigations.\n",
      "Democrats seek clarification from Sondland \n",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, have called on Sondland to clarify his testimony after he appeared behind closed doors on October 17. Sondland's initial testimony appears to have been contradicted by at least two other witnesses, according to CNN reporting and publicly released statements. At the heart of the discrepancy, which Sondland's clarification appears attempting to address, is whether Sondland ever explicitly linked US actions to requests for Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens, and whether he had dangled White House visits or US military aid as a potential quid pro quo.\n",
      "In his October testimony, Sondland said the President had told him directly that \"there is no quid pro quo.\"\n",
      "But Sondland told the House committees that he eventually became aware that Ukraine aid was held up to entice Ukrainian corruption investigations, and eventually realized the investigation was linked to the Bidens. \n",
      "\"Finally at some point I made the Biden-Burisma connection, and then the transcript was released,\" Sondland said during his testimony. He said he couldn't remember specific dates, and for some time hadn't made the connection between the Bidens and Burisma, the Ukrainian natural resources company for which Hunter Biden sat on the board.\n",
      "Sondland described \"a continuum,\" beginning with a May 23 meeting and \"ending up at the end of the line when the transcript of the call came out.\"\n",
      "\"It started as talk to Rudy, then others talk to Rudy,\" he explained. \"Corruption was mentioned. Then, as time went on— and, again, I can't nail down the dates — then let's get the Ukrainians to give a statement about corruption. And then, no, corruption isn't enough, we need to talk about the 2016 election and the Burisma investigations.\"\n",
      "Former US envoy illuminates key meeting \n",
      "Volker's testimony provided more detail into the May 23 meeting with Trump in which the President directed his aides to \"talk to Rudy\" about Ukraine. In that meeting, Volker and other administration officials recommended Trump schedule an Oval Office meeting with the newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But Trump was skeptical.\n",
      "\"They are all corrupt, they are all terrible people,\" Volker recalled Trump saying. \"I don't want to spend any time with that.\"\n",
      "Volker said he became aware of the hold on aid on July 18 -- before the Trump-Zelensky call -- but he did not find out the reason for the hold.\n",
      "\"Nobody ever gave a reason why,\" Volker said.\n",
      "Volker explained that he advised the Ukrainians to drop a public announcement of an investigations into the 2016 election and Burisma after learning that the Justice Department had not requested them, despite what Giuliani was promoting.\n",
      "\"It died. I mean, no one—once we started seeing a tempo of engagement with Ukraine, we had first the sense that Rudy was not going to be convinced that it meant anything, and, therefore, convey a positive message to the President if it didn't say Burisma and 2016,\" Volker said. \"I agreed with the Ukrainians they shouldn't do it, and in fact told them just drop it, wait till you have your own prosecutor general in place. Let's work on substantive issues like this, security assistance and all. Let's just do that. So we dropped it.\"\n",
      "Volker testified that he personally told Giuliani that the source of many of those theories was \"not credible.\" Giuliani has spent much of this year spreading theories about former Vice President Biden and the Democrats peddled by former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsnko.\n",
      "This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n",

      "That's been the watchword of Donald Trump's presidency -- a roiling, sprawling circus of content and controversy that never slows down and never rests. Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?\n",
      "The answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\n",
      "Consider what we've seen just since Friday:\n",
      "1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card\n",
      "2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\n",
      "3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \n",
      "4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\n",
      "5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\n",
      "6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \n",
      "7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails\n",
      "And in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\n",
      "The rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.\n",
      "At one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\n",
      "And the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\n",
      "From a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \n",
      "But by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\n",
      "Even for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.\n",
      "Now consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\n",
      "The real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?\n",

      "Washington (CNN)A senior adviser to Vice President Mike Pence is likely to comply with a request to testify on Thursday in front of the committees leading the impeachment inquiry, multiple sources say.\n",
      "Jennifer Williams would be the first person on Pence's national security team to appear and has knowledge of how much the vice president knew about the efforts by President Donald Trump and those around him to push Ukraine to launch investigations into Joe Biden and his son, as well as 2016 election interference, according to a source familiar with her thinking. \n",
      "Williams, along with other senior administration and national security officials, was listening to the phone call on July 25 in which Trump asked for a \"favor\" of his newly-elected Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, a White House source says. Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\n",
      "Williams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\n",
      "Pence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\n",
      "Lawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.\n",
      "Over a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\n",
      "Since then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\n",
      "The three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "Current and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\n",
      "The official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces. Until Williams joined Pence's staff, she was a spokesperson for several years at the US embassy in London, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also held posts at the embassies in Beirut, Lebanon and Kingston, Jamaica.\n",
      "\"Jen is the type of person who I know to be dedicated to the institution above anything else,\" said Brett Bruen, the former Director of Global Engagement at the White House under President Barack Obama.\n",
      "She comes from the cadre of diplomats \"who are not going to be easily intimidated or hold back information,\" Bruen added. \"She is someone who is pretty tough and has had tough assignments that have steeled her to the kind of pressure and the intimidation tactics that have been used against others.\"\n",

      " (CNN)There are plenty of people arguing that President Donald Trump is breaking the law by encouraging news organizations to out the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine triggered the impeachment investigation.\n",
      "Here's the problem with that view: The President is the law when it comes to protecting national security whistleblowers. And now it's the President who is leading the attack. \n",
      "\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \n",
      "He's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\n",
      "But the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \n",
      "There are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\n",
      "When that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\n",
      "Kohn added: \"If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\n",
      "And Trump has made clear where he stands. \n",
      "He wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\n",
      "\"It's a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\n",
      "But certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\n",
      "The whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\n",
      "Harassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\n",
      "\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\n",
      "Devine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\n",
      "He ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\n",
      "But that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\n",
      "And then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\n",
      "But no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\n",
      "CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \n",
      "\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\n",
      "Toobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\n",
      "\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\n",
      "But that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\n",
      "Ultimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\n",

      "In 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\n",
      "Beshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \n",

      "Trump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \n",
      "Cook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\n",
      "Hood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \n",
      "There is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\n",
      "Vice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\n",

All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\n",
      "Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\n",

      "Voters may be casting ballots for politicians to state government, but their feelings about President Donald Trump will be paramount. That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \n",
      "Kentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \n",
      "Yet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \n",
      "If Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \n",
      "The same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \n",
      "The polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \n",
      "You can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \n",
      "Hood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \n",
      "After the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \n",
      "If there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \n",
      "Those slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \n",
      "Were Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\n",
      "I would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \n",
      "Still, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\n",

      "Washington (CNN)The winner of Mississippi's gubernatorial election Tuesday will not only have to capture the state's popular vote, but will also have to prevail in the state's unique election process for electing a governor and other statewide officials that was established during the Jim Crow era. \n",
      "Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state's popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as \"leans Republican\" -- the state's unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. \n",
      "A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\n",
      "The election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \n",
      "Critics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \n",
      "A federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \n",
      "\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\n",
      "The provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\n",
      "While Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\n",

      "Investigators trying to determine whether Roger Stone obtained information from WikiLeaks first had to interview -- and in some cases legally battle with -- a conspiracy theorist, a stand-up comedian, a house painter fighting his subpoena, a White House adviser whose electronic history was apparently deleted and the so-called Manhattan Madam.\n",

      " (CNN)Investigators trying to determine whether Roger Stone obtained information from WikiLeaks first had to interview -- and in some cases legally battle with -- a conspiracy theorist, a stand-up comedian, a house painter fighting his subpoena, a White House adviser whose electronic history was apparently deleted and the so-called Manhattan Madam.\n",
      "Some of that cast of characters will re-emerge this week for Stone's trial at a federal courthouse in Washington. And new details could be revealed from what former special counsel Robert Mueller found regarding the Trump campaign and Russian influence in the 2016 election.\n",
      "After investigating a number of possible crimes, prosecutors working under Mueller and the DC US attorney settled on obstruction-of-justice-related charges against Stone. This week they will aim to prove to a judge and jury that Stone lied to the House Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the election, aimed to obstruct those proceedings and also tampered with a witness. Stone has pleaded not guilty to all seven charges he is facing.\n",
      "It's unclear yet whether Stone will testify in his own defense, but the last time he took the stand did not go smoothly. And it offers a hint into the dynamic between the reserved sanctity of a federal courtroom -- where no electronics are allowed and disruptions are swiftly dismissed -- and Stone's bombastic personality and efforts to stir public support for himself.\n",
      "Under the big top\n",
      "In February, Stone volunteered to take the stand. Judge Amy Berman Jackson was reviewing a gag order she had placed on the case, which Stone had tested by posting a photo of her on Instagram with crosshairs behind her head. Several times at the hearing, he attempted to argue his side over the judge's questioning, or grimaced and gestured broadly and licked his lips while he spoke. Jackson grew impatient with Stone's imprecise and changing answers at the time.\n",
      "Ultimately, she tightened the gag order, preventing him from speaking publicly about the investigation, the case or any participants in the investigation of the case. \n",
      "In July, Jackson placed even stricter restrictions on Stone's speech, barring him from posting on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and all other forms of social media after finding he purposely tried to gain media attention while under the gag order. \n",
      "\"What am I supposed to do with you? It seems as if, once again, I'm wrestling with behavior that has more to do with middle school than a court of law,\" she told the defendant.\n",
      "People associated with the case have likened the upcoming trial to a \"circus\" or a \"freak show.\" But they also acknowledge that Stone -- who has spent a lifetime practicing in the dark art of political warfare -- is in for the fight of his life.\n",
      "\"Roger faces a really uphill battle, but I have confidence in his legal team, and I am optimistic about his chances,\" said Michael Caputo, who worked on the 2016 Trump campaign and is a friend of Stone's. \"He has never faced a battle like this in his life.\"\n",
      "Given the high-profile nature of the case, the court has put in place several rules surrounding the trial, including blocking media interviews of trial participants inside and outside the courthouse. \n",
      "A filled courtroom and additional rooms for media and spectators are expected at the trial and cameras were already camped outside the courthouse in downtown Washington on Monday, where the parties met with the judge to discuss final trial parameters. Stone, wearing a black suit with white pocket square, declined to comment as he walked inside.\n",
      "Jackson said Monday that everything was in \"excellent shape.\" Jury selection in the trial gets underway Tuesday and opening statements could come as as soon as Wednesday morning. \n",
      "Among those expected to take the stand during the trial are Randy Credico, the stand-up comedian; Steve Bannon, the former White House adviser; Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign deputy chairman; and Andrew Miller, a former marijuana farmer and employee of Stone's. Mueller's team interviewed roughly a dozen of Stone's associates as they aimed to nail down whether Stone had successfully created a backchannel with WikiLeaks to obtain hacked information.\n",
      "The case\n",
      "Stone was arrested in January, in an unexpected pre-dawn arrest at his home in Florida, caught exclusively on camera by CNN. About a dozen officers with heavy weapons and tactical vests fanned out across Stone's lawn. \n",
      "Prosecutors' allegations against him told a scintillating story of how the Trump campaign coordinated with Stone to attempt to learn about stolen documents that, once public, could hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016. Stone communicated with the campaign about his and his associates' attempts to reach WikiLeaks, which was rolling out Democratic documents stolen by the Russians. Prosecutors say he falsely denied to the House he had discussions with the campaign and some others about trying to reach WikiLeaks. Stone has maintained he did nothing wrong -- and has even sold T-shirts saying as much. \n",
      "The trial, more than nine months after his indictment and arrest, could take two weeks or more, partly because of the amount of evidence. By March, prosecutors had turned over nine terabytes of data to Stone's defense team as part of the case, they said in court.\n",
      "\"We could pile it as high as the Washington Monument twice,\" Stone's attorney Robert Buschel told the judge.\n",
      "Amid those piles are, apparently, evidence of phone calls made to President Donald Trump's six work and personal phone lines, and to several other key players whom Mueller investigated, including convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to a recent court filing previewing trial evidence.\n",
      "Gates, Manafort's former deputy, has become a star witness at two previous trials related to the Mueller investigation, and at Stone's he could reveal some of the most tantalizing still-secret information Mueller found about the President.\n",
      "According to the Mueller report, Gates told the special counsel what Trump himself had said during the 2016 campaign related to WikiLeaks and Russian hacking -- two areas Stone also allegedly focused on.\n",
      "But more details about what Mueller learned are redacted in the Mueller report, labeled as secret because of potential harm to an ongoing investigation. Prosecutors have previously said that some of the redactions in the Mueller report are to comply with the court's order not to prejudice Stone's potential jurors.\n",
      "Witness list\n",
      "One of the prosecution's key witnesses, Credico, has expressed anxiety about his upcoming testimony even as he prepares to take the witness stand.\n",
      "Stone told congressional investigators that Credico was one of his points of contact with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, a claim Credico has repeatedly denied. Credico is also the witness that Stone allegedly tried to intimidate into not cooperating with the House Intelligence Committee's investigation.\n",
      "Credico and his lawyer have expressed concern about the online attacks Credico has faced from Stone's fans, particularly after prosecutors published Credico's phone number in a court filing.\n",
      "A comedian, radio personality and progressive activist, Credico often exclaims that he is incapable of sticking to a script, a trait that is sure inspire heartburn in any prosecutor.\n",
      "His dog, a white Coton de Tulear named Bianca, is often in tow to provide emotional support. She accompanied Credico to his interviews with Mueller's team and to his appearance before the grand jury. Bianca will be at courthouse, but it isn't clear if she will join Credico on the witness stand, according to someone familiar with the plan.\n",
      "At one point, Stone allegedly threatened to steal Credico's dog, which prosecutors laid out as evidence that Stone was trying to intimidate a witness.\n",
      "Credico is also central to one of the more significant tangles between prosecutors and the defense team before the trial. Stone had allegedly told Credico he should do a \"Frank Pentangeli,\" referencing a character in the film \"The Godfather: Part II\" who lied to Congress about the mafia family for which he worked. \n",
      "Prosecutors wanted to show a scene from the film in court. But Jackson said they can merely read a transcript if they see fit. \n",
      "On Monday, Stone's attorney tried to restrict the use of the movie even further, arguing that only Credico should speak to what it meant. However, Jackson stuck to her initial ruling.\n",
      "Bannon, a former Breitbart News executive who worked as the chief executive officer of the Trump campaign, is another potential witness for the government \n",
      "Stone's indictment, which referred to Bannon as a \"high-ranking Trump Campaign official,\" revealed how Stone told Bannon to expect \"a load every week going forward\" from WikiLeaks just a month before Election Day 2016.\n",
      "Prosecutors may not have been able to access other potentially relevant messages. The Mueller report noted that messages on Bannon's devices that predated March 2017 were missing. Bannon told investigators \"he did not know why messages did not appear on his device,\" according to the report.\n",
      "Miller, an associate of Stone's who was privy for a time to some of Stone's email accounts and his schedule, has also been subpoenaed for testimony and plans to comply if he's called. Miller, a steampunk house painter from St. Louis, spent months unsuccessfully fighting his subpoena to provide information about Stone before a grand jury.\n",
      "It's still unclear whether prosecutors will call yet another Stone associate, Jerome Corsi, a prolific author and conspiracy theorist, to testify. Stone pointed to Corsi as one of his backchannels to Assange, although Corsi has said he never made contact with the WikiLeaks founder.\n",
      "Last year, prosecutors prepared a draft indictment against Corsi for making false statements to investigators as part of a plea deal. The draft document also alleged that Corsi deleted much of his email correspondence with Stone during the period that Stone was encouraging Corsi to get dirt from WikiLeaks.\n",
      "Rather than take the plea deal, Corsi opted to share the draft indictment with the media. He later released a salacious and typo-ridden book about his experience with the Mueller team. Mueller concluded his investigation without ever bringing charges against Corsi.\n",
      "But the plea agreement and other issues Mueller dug up regarding Stone's cast of potential witnesses could provide opportunities for the defense to undercut their credibility before the jury. Gates, for instance, was a shaky witness at times at Manafort's trial last year, and has pleaded guilty to his own charges and awaits his sentencing.\n",
      "Some of Stone's associates that were not called as witnesses plan to attend his trial anyway. Caputo, who has not been permitted to be in contact with Stone since his arrest, said he plans to be in the courtroom as often as possible.\n",
      "Kristin Davis, famously known as the \"Manhattan Madam,\" was not called to testify at Stone's trial but she still plans to attend the second week of proceedings, her spokeswoman said. She and Stone are longtime friends, and he is her son's godfather.\n",
      "\"I believe Stone is being persecuted because he refused to provide false testimony against the President. I look forward to the truth coming out,\" Davis told CNN last week.\n",

      " (CNN)On Monday night at a campaign rally in Kentucky, home state Sen. Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \n",
      "Here's what Paul said:\n",
      "\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'\"\n",
      "Paul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\n",
      "While that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\n",
      "What Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\n",
      "That's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\n",
      "Here's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\n",
      "The task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\n",
      "To date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\n",
      "Fixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\n",
      "But thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\n",
      "What Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\n",
      "It's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\n",
      "To which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\n",

How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\n",
      "I asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n",
      "Cillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\n",
      "Bailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\n",
      "Bevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\n",
      "Goforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.\n",
      "Attorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\n",
      "Cillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\n",
      "Bailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\n",
      "But there are some clear differences between the two. \n",
      "The President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\n",
      "Bevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\n",
      "Cillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\n",
      "Bailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\n",
      "Andy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\n",
      "He also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\n",
      "Cillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\n",
      "Bailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.\n",
      "Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\n",
      "Bailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\n",
      "The President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\n",
      "Trump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\n",

      "Tent cities emerged across Austin this summer after the city effectively made it legal for homeless residents to camp under highway overpasses.\n",
      "Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:32:08 GMT\n",
      "Austin, Texas (CNN)Tent cities emerged across Austin this summer after the city effectively made it legal for homeless residents to camp under highway overpasses. \n",
      "The move sparked a fierce debate across the city over the best way of dealing with what some residents describe as a homelessness crisis.\n",
      "Steve Adler, Austin's mayor, says while it might seem that the homeless population has grown, the new city ordinance decriminalizing city camping has simply brought people experiencing homelessness out of the shadows.\n",
      "\"They're more visible and I know that's disconcerting to a lot of people. It's disconcerting to see poverty in this city,\" Adler said. \"We haven't created any more people experiencing homelessness.\"\n",
      "The mayor argues that by allowing homeless residents to camp on city streets, it's made their lives safer. He says fewer are sleeping hidden away in the city's wooded areas.\n",
      "The city's approach has drawn the ire of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The Republican governor has unleashed months of social media attacks arguing the relaxed rules spurred lawlessness and indecency in the streets. Even some frustrated Democrats in this liberal city find themselves applauding the Republican governor after he used state resources on Monday to clean up the underpasses. \n",
      "The Texas Department of Transportation posted notices last week at 17 locations announcing it would soon clear out the encampments. Just days later, workers in bright orange vests were scooping up piles of trash and left-behind belongings. The sounds of shovels scraping the concrete competed with the deafening roar of cars driving overhead.\n",
      " \n",
      "The controversial cleanups started Monday under a highway in the southwest part of the city. However, the cleanups only went so far. It's still legal for people to camp under the highways due to the city's revised ordinances, and many of the homeless are expected to return. \n",
      "William Rainey, 56, knew the cleanup was coming and he packed up all of his belongings into two shopping carts. He sat and watched the crews fill dumpsters of discarded items. Rainey says he welcomes the cleanup to remove trash but that the efforts aren't going to help homeless people like him.\n",
      "Rainey ended up on the streets two years ago. He says his life unraveled after his wife died and he fell into a bad crowd. Now he describes himself as \"depressed, down and out.\" He says after the city changed its camping ordinance he moved out of the woods and started sleeping under the bridge that was being cleaned out.\n",
      "\"I'm safe. I feel safe. I'm around people that I know, that camp with me,\" Rainey said. \"Some people don't like homeless people. They'd rather not see us out here.\"\n",
      "Chris Baker, the executive director of a homeless advocacy group called The Other Ones Foundation, loaded up a white truck with bicycles, bags, and tents amid the cleanups, sparing them from becoming trash. \n",
      "\"This is theater, this is political theater,\" Baker said of the cleanups. \"This is just a shuffling around of people that will go on and on forever until we find places that people can be... safe and they can be stable.\"\n",
      "John Wittman, a spokesman for the governor's office, said Abbott would order the cleanups on a weekly basis -- or even more often, if need be -- while the state continues to work on what it says is a plan for a longer-term option.\n",
      " \n",
      "In the meantime, homeless residents like Andrea Aguilar say they're going to keep returning to the underpasses as long as possible. \n",
      "\"I'm not going to run and hide in the woods,\" said Aguilar, who packed up her things and kept them just off to the side of an underpass, waiting for the state to come do the cleanup on Monday. \"I'm going to go right back under the bridge. Right back under there.\" \n",
      "'Austin is way too kind' \n",
      "In June, the city council made it easier for homeless people to sit, lie, and camp in more spaces across Austin, including many sidewalks. Previously, homeless residents were ticketed for such actions, leading to court dates and fines that people wouldn't attend or pay. That made it harder for them to get jobs and housing, said Chris Harris, a homeless advocate who works with a group called Homes Not Handcuffs.\n",
      "The new rules also made it possible for the homeless to congregate in the downtown area and stay closer to resources and jobs, rather than in the woods, away from view. \"People that have come out of hiding now are getting medical attention that they weren't getting,\" said Adler. \"They are getting access to housing and services in ways that did not happen before.\"\n",
      "The outcome resulted in fierce pushback from some business owners and residents across the city. They formed groups opposing the new rules, and launched a petition against the ordinances. Some were seen Monday gathering signatures to recall the mayor. \n",
      "Mark Garcia, who leads the group Take Back Austin, said he's not protesting homelessness but what he called the vagrancy of those taking advantage of the new rules and being homeless by choice. \"The vagrants are clogging up the system and preventing actual homeless people from getting the resources that they need.\"\n",
      "Rainey, who's been residing under an overpass, expressed frustration with others who lived there and who wouldn't pick up their own trash. \"A lot of homeless people are taking advantage and they just don't care. If everybody cared, we... wouldn't have this problem at all. They wouldn't be coming out here to have to clean up.\" \n",
      "Another man who said he was recently out of prison and now lived under an Austin overpass said he doesn't blame people who are upset about the new rules. \"I wouldn't want to see my city like this.\" \n",
      "\"Austin is way too kind,\" he continued. \"I'm from Houston. They would never let me do this.\" \n",
      "Aguilar said the new rules are simply letting people live more comfortably while homeless. \"And why can't we be comfortable?\"\n",
      "'It's a bizarre world'\n",
      "Austin resident Cleo Petricek formed a group called the SAFE Project that has tracked crime near homeless encampments and shelters since the new ordinances went into place. She actively lobbies the city council to come up with another solution to the homelessness problem. \n",
      "A diehard Democrat, Petricek feels frustrated that she's now supporting the actions of a Republican governor, but she's glad someone is using their \"bully pulpit to say 'Hey, Austin, this needs to stop right now.' We're at a crisis point.\"\n",
      "Kent Dahlgren, who described himself as a progressive Democrat, moved to Austin from Portland after the Oregon city's relaxed rules on homelessness affected his wife's business. He said people would sleep and defecate outside the door of the business  and harass customers. \n",
      "Though he feels the new rules in Austin are rooted in compassion, the end result is \"catastrophe,\" and he worries it will turn the political makeup of the city. \"I've never voted Republican, and I'm worried they're going to turn this town red.\"\n",
      "Dahlgren said he can't believe he lines up with politicians like Abbott or even President Donald Trump, who's been admonishing West Coast cities over how they're handling homelessness. \"It's bizarre,\" he said, expressing bewilderment that he agrees with Trump's rhetoric. \"It's a bizarre world.\"\n",
      "In the same vein, Abbott has also taken to Twitter to scold the state's capital and Democratic mayor, posting videos -- some of which have now been debunked -- of what he claims are homeless people causing disarray in Austin. He drew outrage after he retweeted video of a man attacking a car at a stoplight and implied the man was homeless. The man's family told CNN he was not homeless, but was mentally ill and was not taking his medication that day. \n",
      "Critics felt the governor was inflaming the homelessness issue in Austin by worsening stereotypes and stoking fear. Abbott did not respond to a CNN request to be interviewed for this story.\n",
      "Last month, the governor threatened that if the city didn't drastically change its laws by November 1, the state would intervene. He took his first step on Monday with the cleanups under highways, but he also listed other measures the state could enact in Austin, such as bringing in the Health and Human Services Commission to address what he called public safety concerns or using the attorney general's office to seek \"civil penalties for violations of Texas statutes and rules requiring abatement of public health nuisances.\"\n",
      "Critics say Abbott is merely politicizing the issue and playing to his base, not creating any meaningful solutions. \n",
      "\"I don't think he cares about homeless people. I think he cares about the homeless issue in so far as he... wants it to be eradicated,\" said Baker, the homeless advocate. \"If this is the solution that... they're going to try to bring, this is no solution at all.\"\n",

      " (CNN)Faced with a slew of national polls that show roughly half the country supports not only his impeachment but also his removal from office, President Donald Trump did what he always does: Just say stuff.\n",
      "\"Well, you're reading the wrong polls. You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You're read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\n",
      "That response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\n",
      "A bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\n",
      "On Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \n",
      "\"If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!\".\n",
      "And then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \n",
      "\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\n",
      "Presumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\n",
      "Which is fine! And smart!\n",
      "(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\n",
      "But if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \n",
      "Think of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\n",
      "That's not to say Trump's \"real\" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.\n",
      "And honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\n",
      "Why haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\n",
      "No matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\n",

      " (CNN)Julián Castro is laying off his campaign team in New Hampshire and South Carolina as he fights to keep his campaign afloat, a Castro aide tells CNN.\n",
      "The teams in the two early nominating states were told they were being let go on Monday. Their last days at work will be next week, the aide said.\n",
      "This comes after CNN first reported on Saturday that the Castro campaign was looking to downsize, supporting staffers looking for other jobs and pivoting their focus to Iowa, Nevada and Texas.\n",
      "\"In pushing to keep Secretary Castro's critical voice in this race, our campaign, like many others, will make adjustments in staffing and resources,\" Hackett said, in response to a story first reported by Politico. \"This race is shifting as we speak, and Julián will continue to be fearless and defy expectations by making the most of our resources.\"\n",
      "Some Castro aides outside of New Hampshire and South Carolina have taken the campaign up on that offer and other campaigns have received inquiries from would-be former Castro aides.\n",
      "All of this is a bid to keep Castro's campaign solvent as the former Housing and Urban Development secretary works to qualify for the November debate, something he has yet to do.\n",
      "Castro has struggled for months to raise money or get attention in the still large field of Democrats vying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.\n",
      "But the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.\n",
      "Castro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.\n",

      "Few questions may shape the result of the 2020 election more than whether Democrats can exploit the religious gap in attitudes toward President Donald Trump that has emerged among his core constituency of working-class white voters.\n",
      "Tue, 05 Nov 2019 15:24:20 GMT\n",
      " (CNN)Few questions may shape the result of the 2020 election more than whether Democrats can exploit the religious gap in attitudes toward President Donald Trump that has emerged among his core constituency of working-class white voters.\n",
      "While polls generally show Trump retaining strong support overall among blue-collar whites, more detailed results in several recent surveys reveal a critical distinction: Trump faces much more resistance among working-class whites who are not evangelical Christians than among those who are. If Democrats can advance through that opening, it could prove crucial in 2020, because evangelicals compose a much smaller share of the white working-class population in the pivotal Rust Belt battleground states, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, than they do in the South.\n",
      "The divergence over Trump between working-class whites who are and are not evangelicals \"is one of the most important political gaps we have,\" says Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization that studies the role of religion in politics.\n",
      "The widening polarization of the electorate during Trump's tumultuous presidency is magnifying the potential impact of that gap in 2020. The working-class white voters who are not evangelical Christians, especially the women in that group, loom as a potentially decisive swing block between the evangelicals who have rallied around Trump and the non-evangelical college-educated whites who have recoiled from him. \n",
      "On a wide array of cultural and political questions, these non-evangelical blue-collar whites express views that place them between those two antithetical voting blocks. On balance, they lean toward culturally conservative positions, but not nearly as fervently as the evangelical Christians do. And while they express clear concerns about Trump's conduct during his presidency, they aren't nearly as alienated from him as the non-evangelical whites with advanced education. \n",
      "On every front, these voters look closely divided. \"They are cross-pressured,\" says Jones.\n",
      "Voters with most conservative views\n",
      "In the 2018 election, these three groups were roughly similar in size, according to results from the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of media organizations including CNN. White evangelicals at all education levels and college-educated whites who are not evangelicals each cast about 1 in 4 votes. The non-college whites who are not evangelicals represented a little more than one-fifth of voters, with racial minorities making up the remainder.\n",
      "The Public Religion Research Institute's annual American Values Survey, released last month, provides a precise snapshot of these differences. At my request, for several central questions the institute examined the results among these key groups of white voters. First, they divided whites into those with and without four-year college degrees. Then they divided those groups into those who are and are not evangelical Christians. Finally, they split the groups a third time, by gender. (College-educated white evangelicals were too small a group to divide again by gender, so they reported the results for men and women combined; to keep the results comparable, they also reported the results for the college-educated non-evangelicals among both genders.)\n",
      "The results showed that white evangelicals without college degrees consistently take a more conservative stance on social and economic issues than any other segment of voters. The men and women in that group differed little in their staunchly conservative perspective, particularly on issues that touch on racial anxieties. \n",
      "For instance, 75% of non-college white evangelical men and 65% of the women agreed that discrimination against whites is now as big a problem in America as discrimination against minorities; three-fourths of the men and two-thirds of the women also agreed with the harshly worded statement that \"Immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background.\" Four-fifths of the men and two-thirds of the women agreed it is \"necessary to believe in God to be moral and have good values.\" Three-fourths of the men and two-thirds of the women agreed that the \"Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists.\"\n",
      "Differences among white evangelicals\n",
      "An even greater share of college-educated white evangelicals (four-fifths of them) said they believed socialists had taken over the Democratic Party. But on cultural issues, those white-collar evangelicals were considerably less militant than their working-class counterparts. Only a little more than half of the college evangelicals agreed that immigrants are \"invading\" the country or that whites face as much discrimination as blacks; a slight majority of them even rejected the idea that it was \"necessary\" to believe in God to be moral.\n",
      "Jones says the contrast on these responses illuminates a larger point: that the college-educated evangelicals are somewhat less likely to feel a sense of \"siege\" in a changing America than their working-class counterparts do. \"They are less apocalyptic and less apoplectic than non-college evangelicals,\" he says. Still, the non-college white evangelicals set much more of the tone for the group overall because they represent about 70% of the evangelical population, studies by Public Religion Research Institute and other groups have found. \n",
      "The educational differences among evangelicals extend even to one key assessment of Trump: Just over half of the college-educated evangelicals, compared with only about one-fourth of those without degrees, said in the religion research institute's survey that they believe he has damaged the dignity of the presidency.\n",
      "But that skepticism extends only so far: Even three-fourths of the college-educated white evangelicals in the institute's survey said they approve of Trump's performance in office, a result comparable to his support among those without degrees. And just 16% of those college evangelicals support Trump's impeachment and removal from office, compared with 7% of non-college evangelical men and 23% percent of the women. Across all educational levels, evangelical Christians \"are still a solid Trump constituency,\" says Jones. \"They really haven't walked away.\"\n",
      "Non-evangelical whites and Trump\n",
      "At the other end of the spectrum among white voters, Trump faces huge skepticism among college-educated whites who are not evangelicals. These voters, often clustered in suburbs around major metropolitan areas, had been trending toward the Democratic Party since the early 1990s, as cultural issues such as abortion, gun control and gay rights increasingly have defined political debate. That movement has been turbocharged as Trump has polarized the electorate around issues of immigration and race.\n",
      "On key cultural issues, these well-educated non-evangelical whites lean almost as sharply toward the left as evangelicals do toward the right. In the religion institute survey, two-thirds of the college-educated whites who are not evangelicals rejected the idea that whites face as much discrimination as minorities; more than three-fourths disagreed that immigrants are \"invading\" America. Nearly three-fourths of them said it's not necessary to believe in God to be moral. A 55% majority of them said racists have taken over the Republican Party, while 59% rejected the idea that socialists now rule the Democratic Party. \n",
      "On Trump, almost three-fourths of these non-evangelical college whites said he has damaged the dignity of the presidency. Two-thirds of them say they disapprove of his performance in office and more than three-fifths said they would support not only his impeachment but also his removal from office.\n",
      "The working-class whites who are not evangelicals occupy a potentially pivotal space between these two opposing -- and roughly equal size -- groups of evangelicals and non-evangelical college-educated whites. The non-evangelical blue-collar whites display mixed instincts on racial and cultural issues. A slight majority of them agree that whites face as much discrimination as minorities, and an even narrower majority support building Trump's proposed border wall. But only a little more than two-fifths of them agree that immigrants are \"invading\" America, a perspective that draws vastly more agreement among non-college whites who are evangelicals.\n",
      "Their views on Trump are similarly conflicted. More than half of the blue-collar non-evangelical whites say he has damaged the dignity of the presidency -- about twice the level of concern expressed by the non-college evangelicals. Support for impeaching and removing him from office reaches 43% among the men and 46% among the women. And they closely divide over his job performance: 55% of the men, but only 45% of the women, give him positive grades. On both of those measures, they are far more likely than the blue-collar white evangelicals to express negative views about Trump.\n",
      "Two other new surveys offer further insights into what these patterns might mean for 2020. One is the new Nationscape project, a weekly survey of 6,000 Americans conducted by the Democracy Fund's Voter Study Group and two political scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles. At my request, the project combined results of its surveys from mid-July to late October to explore early preferences among these groups in a potential 2020 race between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n",
      "That analysis showed Trump maintaining generally solid support among evangelical Christians. (He did, however, show some signs of potential slippage among evangelical women with college degrees compared with his showing among them in the exit polls for the 2016 election.) At the other end of the white education and religious spectrum, the Nationscape results showed Biden posting an advantage of more than 30 percentage points among college-educated white women who are not evangelicals and a nearly double-digit lead among the equivalent men. Each of those results was roughly the same as Hillary Clinton's performance in 2016, according to exit polls.\n",
      "Compared with the 2016 exit polls, the Nationscape results showed Biden posting his biggest gains among the non-evangelical blue-collar men (trailing Trump among them by just 4 percentage points, compared with Clinton's much larger 23-point deficit in 2016) and the equivalent women: They preferred Biden by 10 percentage points in the Nationscape results, double Clinton's lead last time.\n",
      "Warning signs in Wisconsin\n",
      "Warning signs also emerged for Trump about his standing with non-evangelical whites without college degrees in recent polling in Wisconsin, the state that many believe could prove decisive in 2020. Those voters represent the state's largest single block: They make up just over 44% of Wisconsin's electorate, with the women slightly outnumbering the men, according to cumulative poll results from the Marquette University Law School poll provided by Charles Franklin, a pollster and professor of public policy there. (White evangelicals represent just under one-fifth of the state's voters and non-evangelical college-educated whites about one-fourth. Minorities compose the remaining roughly one-tenth of voters in Marquette's surveys.)\n",
      "As in the national numbers, Trump retains very high approval ratings among white evangelicals in Wisconsin, though with some signs of erosion among those holding college degrees, according to cumulative results from the four most recent Marquette surveys that Franklin provided. In a hypothetical 2020 matchup against Biden, Trump still leads big with white evangelicals, especially the men without college degrees among them, according to combined results from surveys in August and October.\n",
      "The mirror image is that in Wisconsin, as nationally, Trump faces resounding disapproval among the college-educated whites who are not evangelicals, particularly the women: More than two-thirds of them give him negative marks. Those women now prefer Biden over Trump for 2020 by nearly 3 to 1; Biden posts a solid double-digit advantage among the men as well.\n",
      "But the working-class whites who are not evangelicals are more conflicted: 53% of the men say they approve of Trump's performance, while 59% of the women say they don't. In an October survey, the Marquette poll found that while two-thirds of these men oppose Trump's impeachment and removal, the women split almost exactly in half on whether he should be ousted. \n",
      "Matched against Biden, Trump leads among the non-evangelical blue-collar men by 10 percentage points, but trails by nearly 30 points among the women. (By contrast, Trump led in the survey by 40 points among the evangelical non-college white women.)\n",
      "Most Democratic strategists agree that against Trump, the party has only limited opportunities for inroads among blue-collar white men, whether or not they are evangelical Christians. But they generally see a much greater opening among those white, non-college, non-evangelical women -- who some party strategists, slightly tongue in cheek, call WNCNEW. \n",
      "Even compared with the blue-collar non-evangelical men, those women generally express more concern about Trump's behavior and temperament and a greater sense of economic anxiety: In the Public Religion Research Institute survey nearly 3 in 5 of them said they would have trouble pulling together $400 to pay for an emergency, a higher share than any other group of whites. In the 2018 midterm elections, these women moved sharply toward Democratic candidates in House races, according to the exit poll results. \n",
      "Finding a nominee who can consolidate those gains -- especially in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the pivotal Rust Belt states that Trump captured in 2016 -- might be the shortest path back to the Oval Office for Democrats next year.\n",

      "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump seems to sense a chance to leverage expansive, uncheckable power everywhere he looks.\n",
      "A common thread is emerging from the impeachment bombshells, court fights and multiple scandals all coming to head this week inside the one-year mark to the next general election. It's a picture of a President and his men who subscribe to a staggeringly broad interpretation of executive power and have no reservations about using it often for domestic political ends.\n",
      "The trend, which threatens to recast the conception of the presidency shared by America's founders, shone through the first witness testimony released from the impeachment inquiry Monday.\n",
      "One former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who apparently had been in the way of Trump's plans to get dirt from Ukraine on former Vice President Joe Biden, was shocked when the President told his counterpart in Kiev on a phone call that the official US diplomatic representative to his country was \"bad news.\"\n",
      "\"I was very concerned, I still am,\" Yovanovitch said in her October 11 appearance before investigators, saying she felt \"threatened\" by the harassing words of her own President.\n",
      "The comment came after she found that the President was running an off-the-books scheme to bypass US diplomats in the former Soviet state through his political fixer and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n",
      "Another top State Department official, Michael McKinley, testified that he had resigned partly because of the use of the State Department to dig up dirt on Trump's political opponents.\n",
      "\"In 37 years in the Foreign Service and in different parts of the globe and working on many controversial issues, working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that,\" McKinley said, according to a transcript also released on Monday.\n",
      "McKinley also said under oath that he had asked his boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for a statement of support for the beleaguered Yovanovitch.\n",
      "Pompeo told ABC News last month that McKinley had never raised the issue. And the top US diplomat emerges from the testimony as more loyal to Trump's political goals than his own department's mission.\n",
      "Democrats build abuse-of-power case \n",
      "The notion that Trump misused the power of his office to set foreign policy for personal political profit in Ukraine is at the center of the building Democratic impeachment case against him.\n",
      "\"With each new interview, we learn more about the President's attempt to manipulate the levers of power to his personal political benefit,\" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said on Monday.\n",
      "The President's repeated demands for testimony from the whistleblower who blew open the scandal are beginning to sound like he is encouraging a leak that exposes the person's identity -- in itself a questionable use of the mighty powers of his office.\n",
      "Republicans have embraced varied arguments when they are not faulting the integrity of the Democratic impeachment process. Some have argued that there is no quid pro quo -- despite evidence that appears to show Trump made military aid conditional on the opening of investigations on Biden and the 2016 election.\n",
      "Others have argued that Trump has sweeping power to dictate foreign policy and so they deny accusations that he abused a public trust by wielding national power for personal ends. But it is not only in Ukraine where the concept of an unfettered presidency above the law has become a dominant theme of the most unconventional administration in modern history.\n",
      "A US appeals court on Monday rejected Trump's claim that he was not obligated to turn over his tax returns to a grand jury because as President he was immune not only from prosecution but also from investigation.\n",
      "The act of refusing to open his tax returns for voters is a sign in itself that Trump believes the obligations of power accepted by previous presidents do not apply to him.\n",
      "His lawyers went further, however, arguing that since he enjoys special protection, his accountants could not comply with a subpoena to make his returns available to a grand jury.\n",
      "But in writing the opinion for the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals, Chief Judge Robert Katzmann used Supreme Court precedent to reject Trump's claim.\n",
      "Trump now plans to appeal to the Supreme Court in a landmark case that could set the parameters of presidential power for generations if he prevails and will be an early test of the new conservative majority he enshrined on the nation's top bench.\n",
      "Concerns that the administration is using political power for nakedly political ends have also mushroomed in recent days over Attorney General William Barr's foreign travels in pursuit of his inquiry into the origins of the Russian election interference investigation. CNN reports suggest that allied intelligence services have been alarmed that Barr is seeking their assistance in incriminating officials in US spy agencies.\n",
      "Trump has previously repeatedly sought to undermine the independence of the Justice Department and the reputation of former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n",
      "A trend visible ever since Trump took office \n",
      "Although examples of Trump's apparent stretching of presidential authority have piled up in recent days, he's been at it since his first days in office.\n",
      "After all, fired FBI chief James Comey testified to Congress that Trump demanded an oath of loyalty when they met for dinner in early 2017. Such a relationship of patronage would have infringed the invisible wall between the White House and the top organs of justice in the US government.\n",
      "The Mueller report shows how Trump repeatedly demanded that his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, ignore his institutional responsibilities and withdraw his recusal from overseeing the Russia investigation -- an overtly political act.\n",
      "The President's aggressive assertions of his power often seem to be an extension of a domineering character that served him well in the shark pond of New York real estate -- but also often had him brushing up against the law.\n",
      "They often seem bred from a misconception of the powers of the presidency itself -- or a lack of the appreciation for constitutional principles that many of his predecessors shared.\n",
      "For instance, Trump has argued -- inaccurately -- that a Constitution written in repudiation of monarchal or absolute power renders him effectively above the law.\n",
      "\"I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President,\" he said back in July.\n",
      "Uncertain political implications\n",
      "While the trend of Trump's power grabs is clear, their ultimate political implications are yet to be settled.\n",
      "House Democrats seem likely to succeed in impeaching him, and will lay down a historical marker on the limits of presidential power. But if the Republican-led Senate declines to convict Trump of impeachable crimes, the President's past behavior suggests he will perceive a validation of his behavior.\n",
      "While Trump's constant grating against constitutional limits is a big deal in Washington, it's less certain the rest of the nation is as preoccupied by his aberrations.\n",
      "In fact, the Trump reelection campaign is using his unrestrained conduct as a selling point -- arguing in an ad that he's \"No Mr. Nice Guy\" but that his bullish persona is gutting the Washington establishment.\n",
      "Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden has made what he calls Trump's abuses the centerpiece of his campaign, but the party's other potential challengers seem as equally keen to debate health care as an imperial presidency. \n",
      "Some legal experts warn that the current moment is reverberating with national peril.\n",
      "\"We are seeing a misunderstanding amongst many people in the public that this is somehow abusing the President, this is an abuse of process, this is harassment, this is unfair,\" said former federal prosecutor Kim Wehle.\n",
      "\"All Americans have to understand that the office of the presidency has to have checks and balances. Someone else will hold that job,\" Wehle, author of the new book \"How to Read the Constitution -- and Why,\" told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n",
      "\"If we allow that office to have no limitations, no boundaries, eventually, the framers understood this: It is human nature to abuse power and to ultimately use it against regular people.\"\n",

      "With White House officials refusing to testify behind closed doors, the Democrats running the impeachment inquiry began releasing transcripts of previous closed-door testimony, which has taken the better part of a month. \n",
      "First up, they released the depositions of Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was besmirched and who raised concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow foreign policy. They also released testimony from Michael McKinley, a former ambassador and top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who quit his job in protest when Pompeo and others would not stand up for Yovanovitch.  \n",
      "Read a full wrap-up of their testimony or check out the highlights below.\n",
      "1. Yovanovitch said she was warned to 'watch my back'\n",
      "The former ambassador told impeachment investigators that a Ukrainian official warned her in 2019 to \"watch my back\" because of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. \n",
      "\"He basically said, and went into some detail, that there were two individuals from Florida, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were working with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had set up the meetings for Mr. Giuliani with Mr. Lutsenko. And that they were interested in having a different ambassador at post, I guess for because they wanted to have business dealings in Ukraine, or additional business dealings.\" \n",
      "Giuliani helped push Trump to call for Ukraine to investigate Burisma and Hunter Biden. Parnas and Fruman have been charged with unrelated campaign finance violations.\n",
      "2. Yovanovitch felt threatened by Trump's words\n",
      "When Yovanovitch read the transcript of the call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, she was confused and worried.\n",
      "Trump had told Zelenksy of Yovanovitch, \"she's going to go through some things.\"\n",
      "During the testimony in October, Yovanovitch was asked what that could mean.\n",
      "\"I don't know what it meant,\" she said. \"I was very concerned. I still am.\"\n",
      "\"Did you feel threatened?\" she was asked.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she responded.\n",
      "3. The ambassador needed protection from a presidential tweet\n",
      "Yovanovitch also described being told she'd have to leave her post and that she needed to get out of the country -- not for her physical security, but to keep her safe from a Trump tweet.\n",
      "Describing a conversation she had with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who has since been nominated as US ambassador to Russia, Yovanovitch said he specifically mentioned Twitter.\n",
      "\"This was coming from President Trump, this was, you know, final, and that I -- that the reason they pulled me back is that they were worried that if I wasn't, you know, physically out of Ukraine, that there would be, you know, some sort of public either tweet or something else from the White House. And so this was to make sure that I would be treated with as much respect as possible.\"\n",
      "4. She angered Giuliani with a blocked visa\n",
      "Yovanovitch described at length the ties between Giuliani and Victor Shokin, the prosecutor Joe Biden and others opposed in Ukraine for not combating corruption. And she said she helped block a visa for Shokin to visit the US, a trip she later learned was in part so that he could meet with Giuliani to reveal dirt on Democrats. She said Shokin lied on his visa application.\n",
      "5. She asked for support and didn't get it\n",
      "The former ambassador said she asked for support when she was attacked by Giuliani and others. But she didn't get it and one reason is there was a fear that Trump could undercut the State Department.\n",
      "\"What I was told is that there was concern that the rug would be pulled out from underneath the State Department if they put out something publicly. You know, that perhaps there would be a tweet of disagreement or something else.\"\n",
      "6. Sondland told Yovanovitch to protect herself by tweeting a pro-Trump message\n",
      "When she felt criticized by Trump allies and the State Department failed to defend her, Yovanovitch testified that she called US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland for his advice. His advice was to tweet fealty to Trump.\n",
      "\"(Sondland) said, you know, you need to go big or go home. You need to, you know, tweet out there that you support the President, and that all these are lies and everything else.\" \n",
      "He later added: \"You know the President. Well, maybe you don't know him personally, but you know, you know, the sorts of things that he likes. You know, go out there battling aggressively and, you know, praise him or support him.\" \n",
      "Yovanovitch didn't want to tweet about Trump since she's a career foreign service officer. Sondland is not a career diplomat and Trump donor, so it seemed natural to him.\n",
      "7. Trump may have called into Giuliani meeting with Ukraine prosecutor\n",
      "Trump's personal pressure campaign on Ukraine has been thought to focus on the new President there, Volodymyr Zelensky. But Yovanovitch testified officials in Ukraine thought he was also on the phone for a meeting between Rudy Giuliani and then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko.\n",
      "This is far from first-hand information. She said that Lutsenko's deputy told her deputy, who told her. \n",
      "\"So you're saying was that Mr. Lutsenko had told him that the President had phoned into their meeting?\" she was asked.\n",
      " \"Uh-huh,\" she replied.\n",
      " \"Is that a yes?\" she was asked.\n",
      " \"That's a yes,\" she said. \n",
      "8. Sean Hannity may know more than Mike Pompeo\n",
      "If you were to compare the influence of the Fox News host and Trump confidant to the US secretary of state, it's not at all clear who would win.\n",
      "Yovanovitch testified that when she was told she was being recalled, she was told that someone (Pompeo?) would call up Hannity to figure out what was going on.\n",
      "\"What I was told by (Senior State Department official) Phil Reeker was that the Secretary or perhaps somebody around him was going to place a call to Mr. Hannity on Fox News to say, you know, what is going on? I mean, do you have proof of these kinds of allegations or not? And if you have proof, you know, telI me, and if not, stop.\"\n",
      "At the time, Yovanovitch was the subject of attacks by Hannity, Giuliani and Donald Trump, Jr., the President's son.\n",
      "9. Pompeo adviser quit over politics being forced on diplomats\n",
      "\"The timing of my resignation was the result of two overriding concerns: the failure in my view, of the State Department to offer support to Foreign Service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry; and, second, by what appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to advance domestic political objectives,\" McKinley said.\n",
      "He also said he raised the issue of the State Department issuing a statement of support for Yovanovitch before she was recalled, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo never acted on it. \n",
      "Pompeo told ABC News in October that McKinley never raised in concerns, but perhaps the time frame is different since Pompeo is careful to say he heard no complaints after Yovanovitch left Ukraine.\n",
      "\"From the time that Ambassador Yovanovitch departed Ukraine until the time that he came to tell me that he was departing, I never heard him say a single thing about his concerns with respect to the decision that was made,\" Pompeo said.\n",
      "McKinley said he offered his resignation September 30 and stayed on a short time after that, so this period of time is less than a week after the transcript of the call in which Trump disparaged Yovanovitch was released.\n",
      "10. McKinley forwarded allegations of bullying\n",
      "McKinley described his conversations with George Kent, the State Department official overseeing Eurasian policy, and he was told by Kent that the department was not being supportive of people swept into the inquiry. McKinley used the term \"bullying tactics\" and forwarded a memo Kent wrote.\n",
      "11. Republicans are taking part in the inquiry\n",
      "The White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill have attacked the process of the impeachment inquiry for being closed and for not featuring White House lawyers. Democrats have countered that open hearings will come and that Trump will have the opportunity to defend himself. The transcripts clearly show that Republicans are taking part in the testimony. Republican lawmakers and attorneys ask tough questions of the witnesses.\n",
      "Today's podcast\n",
      "What protections does a whistleblower actually have?\n",
      "I guest hosted with David Chalian and we talked to Shan Wu, a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst about what kinds of protections a whistleblower actually has in the law. Listen here.\n",

      "Washington (CNN)The Justice Department said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are \"legally invalid\" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.\n",
      "The guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.\n",
      "Impeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.\n",
      "In the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\n",
      "The five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.\n",
      "OLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\n",
      "The administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\n",
      "The memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\n",

      "Tue, 05 Nov 2019 15:26:35 GMT\n",
      "Washington  (CNN)Republican Sen. Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n",
      "\"I say to tonight to the media: do your job and print his name,\" Paul, a Kentucky Republican, yelled during a rally Trump held in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin ahead of Tuesday's gubernatorial election. The crowd of Trump supporters, many donning \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT\" shirts, erupted into applause and cheers, and some chanted \"Do your job!\" and pointed toward the area where members of the press gathered to cover the event.\n",
      "Paul told the crowd \"we also now know the name of the whistleblower,\" but did not provide any personal knowledge of the person's identity, before going on to echo baseless claims of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \"The whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,\" Paul said. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\n",
      "Several other Republicans have called for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator's insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\n",
      "During the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n",
      "The anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\n",
      "On Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \n",
      "Zaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.\n",
      "In September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.\n",
      "Two sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\n",
      "'Deeply troubling and disappointing' \n",
      "Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.\n",
      "\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,\" King said. \n",
      "\"It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \n",
      "Later on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\n",

      " (CNN)While senators await the House of Representatives to move into the public phase of their impeachment inquiry, aides and members are beginning to prepare for a likely Senate trial.\n",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are cautious: there are no articles of impeachment and the House hasn't voted to impeach the President. But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \n",
      "Talks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. \n",
      "That room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\n",
      "And, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\n",
      "\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\n",
      "Senate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa.

Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\n",
      "Schumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\n",
      "A key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\n",
      "During the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\n",
      "There is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections. Both were in the Senate for Clinton's trial in January and February of 1999. Frequent Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a congressman from South Carolina, was also one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment. \n",

      " (CNN)The release of the Mueller report was just the beginning. The headlines about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation this weekend came after months of legal pressure from CNN and others pressing the Justice Department to make more of his work public.\n",
      "On Saturday, both CNN and BuzzFeed published 274 pages of investigative notes and memos from Mueller's interviews with key witnesses about Russian interference in the 2016 election -- and the Trump campaign's involvement. The documents revealed that President Donald Trump, his family members and his top advisers pushed repeatedly to get access to hacked documents WikiLeaks was releasing throughout 2016. \n",
      "In one memo, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates remembered Trump saying, \"Get the emails.\" Also of note, Mueller had learned that former campaign chairman Paul Manafort had pointed to Ukraine for hacking the Democratic emails, a conspiracy theory that lodged in Trump's mind and became part of what he asked the Ukrainian President for help with in July. \n",
      "The documents illustrated with new examples the factual conclusions Mueller found about how Trump has welcomed foreign help in elections. And they're only the first slim window into the massive trail of Trump campaign activity Mueller's team followed over two years. Mueller's team ultimately interviewed about 500 witnesses and gathered millions of documents, which he distilled into a dense collection of findings in his final report.\n",
      "This is how we got the new documents.\n",
      "The race for public access was on when Mueller finished his work in March.\n",
      "CNN almost immediately began pinging the Justice Department and other agencies with requests for public access to more documents, citing the federal Freedom of Information Act. In all, I sent the Justice Department, FBI and other agencies almost 60 letters requesting different types of communications, memos and investigative paperwork related to the Mueller investigation, with most of my requests emailed out a day or two after Mueller said he was done. \n",
      "Through April and May, the federal agencies deflected nearly all of my requests related to Mueller, often saying they needed more time to review the requested documents because it was \"unusual circumstances\" and would need an unspecified amount of extra time to handle.\n",
      "Under the Freedom of Information Act, the public has a right to access many records created by the federal government, from emails to calendar entries to other notes, within about a month following a request. But requests for sensitive information or lots of papers can take the government years to fulfill. Transparency groups like Judicial Watch and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sue frequently when they don't receive documents quickly, allowing them to jump to the front of the line for access. These groups, when they win, often make the documents public immediately on their websites, and the FBI and other agencies sometimes follow by posting the records on their websites as well.\n",
      "News organizations including CNN, The Washington Post and others have worked together and succeeded in getting public access to sealed court records from the Mueller investigation. But most groups waited for Mueller to say he was finished before pushing FOIA issues into court.\n",
      "Jason Leopold at BuzzFeed News, a reporter who's become known for his aggressive records requests and lawsuits fighting for the release of documents, also filed many Freedom of Information Act requests about Mueller. So had the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a transparency group that was first out of the gate to sue for access to Mueller's records. \n",
      "It sued under FOIA for the Mueller report and other documents Mueller created the day he announced his investigation was over. BuzzFeed News stepped up with its own set of lawsuits in early June, lumping dozens of Leopold's requests into each suit. One of BuzzFeed's lawsuits asked for a plethora of records that fell into six different categories, one being \"all FBI 302s,\" meaning memos from witness interviews, \"maintained/stored/in possession of the FBI\" related to the Mueller investigation.\n",
      "CNN sued on June 4 for access to documents I had requested more than a month earlier: the \"FBI memoranda, such as 302s, from any and all of the interviews\" of the 500-some witnesses in the Mueller investigation, plus \"any and all case files related to\" those witnesses. Our lawyers, editors and I had realized we wanted to prioritize what we asked for when we went to court. We had zeroed in on the FBI 302s as our highest priority -- the limited, main set of documents we wanted the federal court's help to make public, and quickly.\n",
      "Because both CNN and BuzzFeed had specifically asked for the FBI witness memos from the Mueller investigation, CNN's focused lawsuit was eventually combined with BuzzFeed's broader one.\n",
      "Judge Reggie Walton of the federal court in Washington agreed with our news organizations' legal teams. At a hearing in early October, Walton ruled that the Justice Department should turn over the 302s in monthly chunks to CNN and BuzzFeed. \n",
      "\"Obviously there is a real concern as to whether there is full transparency,\" Walton had said, shortly after the Electronic Privacy Information Center and BuzzFeed had taken their requests to court this summer.  He reiterated his concern about how slow a track the administration was on in making Mueller's documents transparent. \"The American public is going to become totally disillusioned,\" he said at the October hearing, after the Justice Department explained it didn't have the resources to process the recent avalanche of public records requests.\n",
      "Walton gave the Justice Department its first deadline for November 1. The judge added that the administration must process 500 pages a month of the witness memos, and give CNN and BuzzFeed the public documents on the first of every month. \n",
      "So the Justice Department overnighted Leopold and me CDs on Friday. My request's FedEx tracking number gave a November 2 delivery -- a day late, and a weekend when Washington was largely distracted by its World Series parade.\n",
      "Saturday morning, I drove to our lawyers' office in downtown DC, where a mail room employee had been specially waiting for the package's arrival. The handoff was complete. \n",
      "When I got the disc back to CNN's Washington bureau and popped it in a computer, one file held 274 pages containing redacted FBI memos. The memos described some of Mueller's interviews with Gates, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Among the documents, the Justice Department also provided the additional handwritten notes and relevant emails. The rest of the 500 pages due to us were withheld for reasons the Freedom of Information Act allows, the Justice Department said.\n",
      "In less than a month, we're expecting the next CD.\n",
      "The House of Representatives, in its impeachment investigation, is pursuing some of the same witness records under different law from FOIA. So far, the House has seen witness interview memos for 17 Mueller witnesses, including White House staffers Sean Spicer, Stephen Miller, Sarah Sanders and others. The Justice Department has said in court that it's working on getting another 16 witnesses' memos, including Bannon's and Gates', to the House. \n",
      "Conceivably, the memos CNN and BuzzFeed receive in the future could shed more light on what other key witnesses, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former White House counsel Don McGahn, said during their interviews. A few are already publicly available, like the memo the FBI wrote after interviewing Flynn in January 2017, when he lied.\n",
      "Of those other 57 Freedom of Information Act requests I made related to the Mueller investigation, only one has come through. It turned up three pages of unnoteworthy emails about Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman's recusal from his office's investigation into Cohen, which was previously known.\n",
      "The Justice Department has said it could take years to get us all 44,000 pages of the FBI memos that the judge has ordered it to make public -- and that's only a sliver of the millions of documents from the Mueller investigation.\n",

      "Then he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\n",

      "Here is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \n",
      "\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\n",
      "Got that?\n",
      "Let's break it down claim by claim.\n",
      "1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.\n",
      "2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\n",
      "3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\n",
      "4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\n",
      "In summary: Trump went from\n",

      "B) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\n",
      "C) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \n",
      "D) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\n",
      "He can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:\n",
      "A fact check\n",
      "As Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\n",
      "Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" \n",
      "The Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call's aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\n",
      "The whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \n",
      "The White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \n",
      "Trump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\n",
      "It was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\n",

      "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**On the roster: Trump touts his ‘angry majority’ ahead of elections - Poll: Biden widens lead over Trump, now 17 points - Key witness reverses testimony, admits quid pro quo - Audible: Like Verdun, but for politics - Beep, beepTRUMP TOUTS HIS ‘ANGRY MAJORITY’ AHEAD OF ELECTIONSFox News: “At a rally on friendly turf in Kentucky Monday night, President Trump urged what he called an ‘angry majority’ of voters to send a powerful ‘signal’ to Democrats and the world by handing the GOP a big victory not only in Tuesday's gubernatorial race there, but also in the pivotal upcoming statewide elections in Virginia, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The result of the showdown in Kentucky -- as well as Tuesday's gubernatorial race in Mississippi and state legislature races in Virginia -- could serve as a barometer this week on whether Trump still has the ability to rally Republicans at the voting booth amid Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats have acknowledged that Trump's influence helped the GOP sweep key House special elections in North Carolina in September. Amid chants of ‘USA’ at Monday's rally, Trump repeatedly sought to leverage his accomplishments in office, including energy independence and historically low unemployment rates, to boost Gov. Matt Bevin.”Trump: Bevin ‘a pain in the ass,’ but worth a second term - Lexington Herald Leader: “President Donald Trump gave Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin a Trumpian endorsement Monday night, just hours before Kentuckians go to the polls to decide if they’ll elect the Republican governor to a second term. ‘He’s such a pain in the ass,’ Trump said of Bevin. ‘But isn’t that what you want?’ It was a backhanded compliment meant to highlight how hard Bevin works for Kentucky, but it also called attention to the governor’s biggest political weakness: his penchant for making controversial remarks that alienate friends and foes alike. … The event, though, has huge importance for Bevin, who is locked in a tight race with Democrat Andy Beshear, the attorney general. Bevin has tied himself tightly to the president as he attempts to win back support after waging a public battle with teachers over their pension system.”Unusually close race in Mississippi - AP: “Mississippi’s most competitive governor’s race in years was in the hands of voters Tuesday as Attorney General Jim Hood sought to become the second Democratic governor in the Deep South. He’s facing Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who got campaign help in Mississippi from both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Hood, Reeves and two lesser-known candidates are on Tuesday’s ballot. The winner will succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. Democrats see Hood as their strongest nominee in nearly a generation in a conservative state where Republicans have been governor for 24 of the past 28 years.”Republican majorities on the line in Old Dominion - WTOP: “Virginians are going to the polls Tuesday to cast votes in local elections as well as General Assembly races that could change the composition of both chambers of the state’s legislature, while several D.C.-area towns in Maryland hold elections for mayor and council. In Virginia, the Republicans control both houses by the narrowest of margins. They hold a 21-19 advantage in the Senate and a 51-49 margin in the House of Delegates — that last only after a random drawing decided a tied election in District 94. These General Assembly elections will be the only ones conducted using the district maps chosen by a panel of federal judges in January, after ruling last year that lawmakers had racially gerrymandered 11 House districts by packing black voters into them.”THE RULEBOOK: BETTER NOT \n",
      "“Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 23TIME OUT: ‘TOO MODERN FOR ITS TIME’Atlantic: “Karolina Pavlova, born in 1807, wasn’t a woman who acted in accordance with social norms. The leader of a respected Moscow literary salon, she was also devoutly committed to her own writing. That trait was greeted with animosity from many of her male contemporaries, who disparaged her readiness to share her work as unwomanly and approached her soaringly emotive poetry with suspicion. Even so, Pavlova’s novel A Double Life shook the Russian literary world when it was published in 1848, earning widespread praise for its revolutionary form and psychological acuity. Pavlova had written a book depicting a woman’s struggle against social constraints, and—a full half century before Freud popularized the idea of the subconscious—insisting on the independence of the unconscious mind. …Barbara Heldt [translated] and released [a new edition] this year… Pavlova constructed a strikingly prescient psychological vision: a mind responding to extreme social pressure by slowly and completely separating itself into parts, but giving few external indications of change.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\n",

But among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of Trump, he receives no more than 7 percent support. Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent). South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the other two Democrats tested against Trump, also lead the president among registered voters, with Buttigieg up by 52 percent to 41 percent, and Harris ahead by 51 percent to 42 percent.”Castro gives up on New Hampshire and South Carolina - Politico: “Julián Castro’s campaign will fire its staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, an official familiar with the campaign told POLITICO. The campaign notified the state teams on Monday and their final day will be next week. The source said the campaign will continue focusing on Iowa and Nevada with a $50,000 television ad buy in Iowa beginning Tuesday morning. The moves amount to a long-shot attempt to remain in the presidential contest in the hopes of catching fire before the first contests begin next February. Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Barack Obama, has had success in framing — and, in some cases, starting — the Democratic primary’s policy debates but has struggled to raise money or raise his poll numbers above low single digits. Asked for comment, the Castro campaign pointed POLITICO to its statement last week when news of an Iowa-Nevada focus first surfaced.”Buttigieg adjusts campaign to utilize the moment - WaPo: “What is going on is Buttigieg seizing an opening in the Democratic presidential field, pushing his way into the gap between liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the more moderate former vice president Joe Biden. ‘The way we think this shapes up is, if you want the most ideological, far-out candidate possible, you’ve got your answer. You want the most Washington candidate possible, you’ve got your answer,’ Buttigieg said Saturday from his campaign bus in Iowa. … That positioning represents a significant shift from Buttigieg’s posture when he entered the race. Buttigieg made early headlines by portraying himself as the vanguard of generational change, a 37-year-old seeking to become the first openly gay president and talking up big liberal ideas, like abolishing the electoral college and restructuring the Supreme Court. While his campaign says he still supports those policies, he rarely mentions them on the campaign trail these days.”Harris’ long, hard fall - Politico: “Interviews with more than 50 people inside and around [Kamala Harris’] campaign … reveal how a candidate with so much promise, range and charisma has slid so far. Many of her dilemmas are self-creations. Harris undermined her national introduction with costly flubs on health care, feeding a critique that she lacks a strong ideological core and plays to opinion polls and the desires of rich donors. She was vague or noncommittal on question after question from voters at campaign stops. She leaned on verbal crutches instead of hammering her main points in high-profile TV moments. The deliberate, evidence-intensive way she arrives at decisions—one of her potential strengths in a matchup with Trump—often made her look wobbly and unprepared. … Her prospects look grim. Once-optimistic forecasts from her aides now diverge into complaints about biased treatment from the news media, some of them valid. But Harris has also struggled to figure out how to embrace her own record.”Swingers, 2020 edition - NYT: “They are similar in holding ideologically inconsistent views, but they otherwise span all walks of life, based on an analysis of 569 respondents to recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys in the six closest states carried by the president in the 2016 presidential election. These voters represent 15 percent of the electorate in the battleground states, and they say there’s a chance they’ll vote for either Mr. Trump or the Democrat. … The poll adds a new mix of characters to the quadrennial cast of swing voters, like a somewhat conservative, college-educated suburban man who does not approve of the president’s performance, but strongly opposes a single-payer health system. … For now, these persuadable voters in battleground states have a favorable view of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but not of Elizabeth Warren, our polling shows.”Team Obama makes show of support for cash-strapped Biden - Politico: “More than 30 high-ranking Obama administration officials are hosting a Wednesday soiree for Joe Biden intended to be equal parts fundraiser and public show of support for the former vice president’s 2020 campaign. The event is taking place at the home of ex-National Economic Council director Jeff Zients and his wife, Mary, as Biden hustles to raise money before primary voting begins. Biden's fundraising flagged during the most recent quarter, but Zients and others are also trying to send a message beyond the money chase, according to people familiar with the event planning. They want to show that while some Obama allies may have drifted toward candidates newer to the national political scene, including Pete Buttigieg, Biden still has support from many of his former administration colleagues.”Steyer aide out after swiping Harris volunteer data - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “A South Carolina aide for Tom Steyer’s 2020 presidential campaign stole valuable volunteer data collected by Kamala Harris’ campaign using an account from when he worked with the S.C. Democratic Party, according to multiple state and national party officials. The Steyer campaign said that it does not have possession of the data and that Democratic officials were only aware of the download, which they said was inadvertent, because they proactively notified them. Both the Democratic National Committee and S.C. Democratic Party denied that. The Democratic National Committee said they quickly caught the attempt on Friday by Steyer’s deputy S.C. state director Dwane Sims to export Harris’ data, which contained thousands of volunteer contacts collected over the course of the campaign in this critical early-voting primary state.”Nathan Gonzales: A year out, here's four scenarios for 2020 elections - Roll Call: “Even though predicting anything to do with Trump might seem like a risk because of how typically damaging stories don’t seem to impact his standing, the president is a historically unpopular figure whose job approval rating has been static for months. … Trump remains incredibly popular with the Republican base, however, and the GOP has transitioned to primarily embracing a person more than a conservative ideology. That could eventually create a messy transition of power, but for now, it gives the president a high electoral floor as Republicans rally to his cause. … Following are four scenarios, in order of their likelihood: Scenario 1: Eviction at 1600 … Scenario 2: Blue Washington … Scenario 3: Status Quo … Scenario 4: Red Revival.”  KEY WITNESS REVERSES TESTIMONY, ADMITS QUID PRO QUONYT: “A critical witness in the impeachment inquiry offered Congress substantial new testimony this week, revealing that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country likely would not receive American military aid unless it publicly committed to investigations President Trump wanted. The disclosure from Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in four new pages of sworn testimony released on Tuesday, confirmed his involvement in essentially laying out a quid pro quo to Ukraine that he had previously not acknowledged. The testimony offered several major new details beyond the account he gave the inquiry in a 10-hour interview last month. Mr. Sondland provided a more robust description of his own role in alerting the Ukrainians that they needed to go along with investigative requests being demanded by the president’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.”Transcripts suggest GOP lacks impeachment strategy - WaPo: “Republicans have complained for weeks about the secret House impeachment inquiry… But inside the secure room in the Capitol basement where the proceedings are taking place, Republicans have used their time to complain that testimony has become public, going after their colleagues who were quoted in media reports commenting on witness appearances, and quizzing witnesses themselves on how their statements had been released. The efforts by GOP lawmakers to shape the Democrats’ inquiry emerged in full view for the first time Monday with the release of hundreds of pages of transcripts from two early witnesses: Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. … But the newly released transcripts from Yovanovitch and McKinley — who appeared on Oct. 11 and Oct. 16, respectively — underscore how the Republicans’ strategy at that relatively early stage in the deposition process was more scattershot, covering a range of topics.”PLAY-BY-PLAYUnited States begins process of withdrawing from Paris climate deal - Fox NewsRNC paid $60,000 for Trump and entourage to watch cage-fighting - WaPoCalifornia drives out conservatives to ‘redder pastures’ - LATRep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., faces ethics probe over financial disclosure - PoliticoAUDIBLE: LIKE VERDUN, BUT FOR POLITICS\n",

      "[Ed. note: Somebody sold you a bum steer, I’m afraid, Mr. Alexander. In our most recent poll, 49 percent of respondents identified themselves as Democrats, 41 percent identified themselves as Republicans and 11 percent identified themselves as independents. Our numbers for both parties are higher than in other polls because our questionnaire gives respondents of being strong partisans, weak partisans or independents. Others, like this week’s WaPo/ABC News poll, force subjects to choose among just three options. But the result is about the same: a six-point edge for Democrats. In the WSJ/NBC News poll out this week, pollsters gave respondents seven (!) options on a partisanship scale, but the net effect is the same: Republicans trailed Democrats by 8 points. Those advantages for Democrats have been pretty consistent in recent years and over the history of public opinion polling. Certainly exit polls and our Fox News Voter Analysis consistently show that Democrats outnumber Republicans in elections. That’s why Republicans rely so much on independent and loosely affiliated voters to win elections. If the GOP starts doing better going into 2020, I would expect to see more independents expressing solidarity for the Red Team. But we’ll continue to track partisan affiliation in part because it provides valuable insight on how persuadable voters are moving.

      "[Ed. note: I’m always a little mystified about why so many Republicans harp on this subject. I never hear Democrats say that the other side should be called the Republic Party. As far as I can tell, the values of the Democratic Party are in line with the name. The party is generally (and increasingly) opposed to many limits on democracy. The Electoral College, disproportionate Senate representation, lifetime Supreme Court appointments and other small-r republican institutions are quite unpopular among progressives. More direct democracy, including low-to-zero barrier to ballot access, seems to be a top goal for many in the party. I also see some anti-republican trends among Republicans, particularly as it relates to a disregard bordering on disdain for the power of the legislative branch and a monarchical bent toward presidential power. But I think, generally, the parties are still in the respective lanes suggested by their names. But most of all, why wouldn’t you call people by the name they prefer? That just seems like good manners.

As his lawyers have argued in the past, he had ample reasons to cover up his relationships with a sex worker and a nude model – hush money he would have paid whether he was running for office or not. There are some additional considerations about hiding income, etc., but it still seems like a tough case to make.

      "Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says aid was withheld due to concerns of corruption in Ukraine and concerns that European nations weren't contributing their fair share; Kristin Fisher reports.\n",
      "House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump have requested that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appear before the panels for a deposition on Friday, claiming that he was “directly involved” in the Ukraine controversy which sparked the proceedings.\n",
      "House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel penned a letter to Mulvaney on Tuesday, requesting his appearance at a deposition as part of the impeachment inquiry this Friday at 9 a.m.\n",
      "NEW DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED\n",
      "“Based on evidence gathered in the impeachment inquiry and public reporting, we believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the House’s impeachment inquiry,” they wrote.\n",
      "“Specifically, the investigation has revealed that you may have been directly involved in an effort orchestrated by President Trump, his personal agent, Rudolph Giuliani, and others to withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trump’s personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so,” they continued.\n",
      "The request for Mulvaney’s deposition comes amid the House’s formal impeachment inquiry into the president. The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\n",
      "A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\n",
      "In the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced “evidence,” such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaney’s role in Trump’s conversations with Zelensky.\n",
      "“…Bolton told a National Security Council staffer ‘to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaney’  to pressure Ukraine for political help,” they wrote.\n",
      "“Ambassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the President’s scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, ‘I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,’” they wrote. “The ‘drug deal’ appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.”\n",
      "The chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing “a central role” in the president’s move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.\n",
      "“You admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the President’s own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,” they wrote.\n",
      "During a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White House’s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\n",
      "“We do that all the time with foreign policy,” Mulvaney said. “And I have news for everybody: Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.”\n",
      "Mulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.\n",
      "“Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trump’s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the President’s 2020 re-election campaign,” they wrote.\n",
      "It is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n",

      "Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, according to transcripts released Tuesday, pushed back on the claim that President Trump sought to withhold a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Kiev committed to investigate allegations concerning the 2016 election -- while also denying that Trump was seeking “dirt” on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n",
      "The deposition transcripts, though, also reflect officials' concerns about the involvement of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in seeking politically related investigations out of Ukraine. Further, they offer varying accounts of whether a quid pro quo of some kind -- involving either a meeting or the release of U.S. military aid -- may have been presented.\n",
      "One of the most significant revelations from Tuesday's release is that E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement -- a revelation that was quickly hailed by Democrats of proof of the quid pro quo they have been alleging took place.\n",
      "Other sections presented a muddier picture. In the transcript of his closed-door deposition last month with lawmakers conducting the impeachment probe, Volker was asked if Trump withheld or delayed a meeting with Zelensky absent a pledge to probe concerns Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n",
      "GIULIANI SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE DEMS FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n",
      "“The answer to the question is no, if you want a yes-or-no answer. But the reason the answer is no is we did have difficulty scheduling a meeting, but there was no linkage like that,” he said.\n",
      "Recently revealed text messages showed Volker appearing to link the investigations to a D.C. visit by Zelensky. The deposition transcript seems to reflect Volker asserting the contrary. Sondland, too, testifying about a conversation he had with White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, said he didn't tell him the investigations were needed in order for there to be a White House visit.\n",
      "\"That was never linked,\" he said. \"That was only specifically brought into the press statement for a brief period of time through Mr. Giuliani when we were negotiating a press statement.\"\n",
      "At another point in the transcript, though, Sondland said he eventually thought \"there might be a link between the White House visit and aid to the Ukraine that was being held up.\"\n",
      "House Democrats established the impeachment inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged him to “look into” allegations surrounding the 2016 election and the Biden family’s activities in the country. Democrats have alleged that a quid pro quo took place, with Trump leveraging military aid until the Ukrainians investigated the claims. Trump and Zelensky have claimed that no pressure was placed on them, but statements from certain officials have challenged that narrative.\n",
      "While the White House released the transcript of the call, and a House committee released the original complaint by the whistleblower that sparked the process, much of the inquiry is now focusing on what officials understood to be the president’s intent at the time. While military aid was initially locked, it was eventually unblocked by Congress.\n",
      "Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor recently testified that he understood the White House was willing to hold up both military aid and a prospective White House meeting to extract a public announcement from the country that probes were underway.\n",
      "US ENVOY SONDLAND WORKED WITH GIULIANI ON UKRAINE CORRUPTION STATEMENT, VOLKER TESTIFIED: SOURCES\n",
      "“By mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,” Taylor testified, referring to Burisma Holdings -- a Ukrainian energy firm where Joe Biden’s son Hunter sat on the board. A transcript of the July call shows Trump sought an investigation concerning Joe Biden’s involvement in seeking the ouster of a prosecutor looking into that firm.\n",
      "Yet while Sondland had texted Taylor in September saying there was no quid pro quo, the transcripts released Tuesday of his deposition include a supplemental declaration, in which he says that “by the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.”\n",
      "He also acknowledged telling one of Zelensky’s advisers that “resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.”\n",
      "In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham still said the transcripts show less evidence for the \"illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought.\" She noted that Sondland said he \"presumed\" there was a link to the aid—\"but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption.\"\n",
      "In another excerpt from the testimony, Sondland described how the discussions about a statement on corruption in general in Ukraine became more explicitly about Biden-Burisma as a \"continuum\" amid the involvement of Giuliani, who was pushing the Biden-Burisma agenda.\n",
      "\"It kept—it kept getting more insidious as [the] timeline went on, and back in July, it was all about just corruption,\" he said.\n",
      "Separately he told lawmakers that Trump repeatedly urged Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to talk to Giuliani.\n",
      "\"He didn’t even -- he wasn’t even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying: 'Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,'\" he said.\n",
      "Volker too spoke about Giuliani's involvement, telling lawmakers that \"the negative narrative about Ukraine which Mr. Giuliani was furthering was the problem.\"\n",
      "Democrats seized on the testimony as proof of a quid pro quo, saying it was a sign that \"the president's scheme comes into clearer focus.\"\n",
      "“It is clear from their testimony that, in exchange for the statement, President Trump would award the Ukrainian president with a highly coveted White House meeting and, later, with millions of dollars in critical military aid being withheld,\" the statement from the chairs of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees said. \"Ambassador Sondland called this changing U.S. policy toward Ukraine a ‘continuum’ that became ever more ‘insidious’ over time.\"\n",
      "DIPLOMAT BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES TRUMP USED UKRAINE AID, WHITE HOUSE MEETING AS LEVERAGE FOR PROBES\n",
      "The statement from Sondland contrasts with his texts with Taylor, who had expressed concern about what he saw as a quid pro quo.\n",
      "\"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said in a text exchange in September.\n",
      "“The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind,” Sondland texted back. “The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.”\n",
      "Sondland, though, explained to the committees that Trump said something similar to him during a phone call, in which he said Trump was in a \"bad mood\" and nearly hung up on him.\n",
      "\"I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,\" Trump said, according to Sondland. \"I want Zelensky to do the right thing.\"\n",
      "Volker, meanwhile, on the morning of a planned July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, seemed to link a White House visit with the investigations, despite his more recent testimony. He texted a Zelensky aide: \"Heard from White House -- Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\"\n",
      "In his testimony, Volker was also asked if he would say that Trump asked Zelensky to “manufacture dirt on the Bidens.”\n",
      "“No,” he said. “And I’ve seen that phrase thrown around a lot. And I think there’s a difference between the manufacture or dig up dirt versus finding out did anything happen in the 2016 campaign or did anything happen with Burisma. I think – or even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something.”\n",
      "On the question of the hold placed on aid, he said it struck him as \"unusual\" but that \"no reason was ever given as to why that was.\"\n",

      "While a number of Trump’s picks are filling seats previously held by judges appointed by Republican presidents, many are taking the place of liberal jurists appointed by Democrats. The Ninth Circuit, for example, once known as a staunchly liberal Court of Appeals, is gradually evening out.

      "Democrats have been fierce in their opposition to several of Trump’s selections. Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counsel’s office. A segment on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled \"Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy.\" Maddow cited Menashi’s use of the term “ethnonationalism” to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on the “fringe of racial thinking.”\n",
      "During questioning, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that Menashi had faced “unusually personal” and “vicious” attacks.\n",
      "Menashi denied the allegations, saying, “It’s hurtful and I think it misrepresents what I’ve written.”\n",
      "During his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on “constitutional traditions.\"\n",
      "Menashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.\n",
      "The American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as “Well Qualified,” its highest mark.\n",
      "The ABA’s rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a “Not Qualified” rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\n",
      "The ABA’s letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigants and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had run against VanDyke for a judicial position.\n",

      "As \"Medicare-for-all\" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary, a new report released by the British government on its National Health Service, or NHS, offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.\n",
      "The report on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, details increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visits to cancer care. And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.\n",
      "\"Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,\" the report also declares.\n",
      "An American \"Medicare-for-all\" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system. Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.\n",
      "But the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range of Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.\n",
      "Critics in the United States have said that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.\n",
      "\"Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'\" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday. \"Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.' But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?\n",
      "\"There’s a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren won’t admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.\"\n",
      "The report on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standards in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.\n",
      "\"In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,\" the report says of cancer wait times. \"During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded. The target of 85% has been missed for all but one month since April 2014.\"\n",

      "An aide in South Carolina for 2020 Democratic presidential primary hopeful Tom Steyer has resigned after it was discovered that he stole volunteer data from the campaign of rival candidate Sen. Kamala Harris of California.\n",
      "Steyer’s campaign confirmed on Monday evening that Dwane Sims, the billionaire candidate’s deputy South Carolina state director, offered his resignation following an internal investigation into the allegations that he stole the data of thousands of contacts from the Harris campaign. \n",
      "“Last week, the South Carolina Democratic Party turned off voter file access to the Steyer campaign for a short period of time. When it was reinstated, Dwane Sims, a former South Carolina Democratic Party employee, had access to other presidential campaign data,” Heather Hargreaves, Steyer’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “When we first learned about the matter, we conducted an internal investigation and wiped Mr. Sims’ computer to make sure the data was completely deleted and that there was no access to other campaign data.”\n",
      "DAVID AVELLA: TOM STEYER IS BIDEN'S BIGGEST THREAT\n",
      "She added: “We understand the sensitivity and importance of this information. We apologize to the South Carolina Democratic Party and the DNC. Tom Steyer and the Steyer campaign extend our deepest apology to Senator Kamala Harris and her campaign.”\n",
      "The Steyer campaign noted that the South Carolina Democratic Party had turned off access for a short time last week to voter files and when it was reinstated Sims – as a former employee of the state party – had access to information on other presidential candidates' data. Sims called the SCDP “[w]ithin minutes of realizing this” and access was disabled, according to Steyer’s campaign.\n",
      "But in a story first reported by The Post and Courier of Charleston, officials from the SCDP and the Democratic National Committee said they actually intervened in Sims' attempt to export the data, which included thousands of voter contacts built up by Harris' campaign.\n",
      "\"Our organizers and volunteers work incredibly hard, and as this story notes, our campaign ‘has built a particularly extensive field organizing operation in South Carolina,’” Ian Sams, the Harris campaign’s national press secretary, said in a tweet. “It's unfortunate anyone would try to steal that work from our team.\"\n",

      "Sims was announced last month as Steyer's deputy state director in South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South.

The result of the showdown in Kentucky -- as well as Tuesday's gubernatorial race in Mississippi and state legislature races in Virginia -- could serve as a barometer this week on whether Trump still has the ability to rally Republicans at the voting booth amid Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats have acknowledged that Trump's influence helped the GOP sweep key House special elections in North Carolina in September. Amid chants of âUSAâ at Monday's rally, Trump repeatedly sought to leverage his accomplishments in office, including energy independence and historically low unemployment rates, to boost Gov.Â Matt Bevin.âTrump: Bevin âa pain in the ass,â but worth a second term -Â Lexington Herald Leader: âPresident Donald Trump gave Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin a Trumpian endorsement Monday night, just hours before Kentuckians go to the polls to decide if theyâll elect the Republican governor to a second term. âHeâs such a pain in the ass,â Trump said of Bevin. âBut isnât that what you want?â It was a backhanded compliment meant to highlight how hard Bevin works for Kentucky, but it also called attention to the governorâs biggest political weakness: his penchant for making controversial remarks that alienate friends and foes alike. â¦Â The event, though, has huge importance for Bevin, who is locked in a tight race with DemocratÂ Andy Beshear, the attorney general. Bevin has tied himself tightly to the president as he attempts to win back support after waging a public battle with teachers over their pension system.âUnusually close race in Mississippi -Â AP: âMississippiâs most competitive governorâs race in years was in the hands of voters Tuesday as Attorney GeneralÂ Jim HoodÂ sought to become the second Democratic governor in the Deep South. Heâs facing Republican Lt. Gov.Â Tate Reeves, who got campaign help in Mississippi from both President Donald Trump and Vice PresidentÂ Mike Pence. Hood, Reeves and two lesser-known candidates are on Tuesdayâs ballot. The winner will succeed term-limited Republican Gov.Â Phil Bryant. Democrats see Hood as their strongest nominee in nearly a generation in a conservative state where Republicans have been governor for 24 of the past 28 years.âRepublican majorities on the line in Old Dominion -Â WTOP: âVirginians are going to the polls Tuesday to cast votes in local elections as well as General Assembly races that could change the composition of both chambers of the stateâs legislature, while several D.C.-area towns in Maryland hold elections for mayor and council. In Virginia, the Republicans control both houses by the narrowest of margins. They hold a 21-19 advantage in the Senate and a 51-49 margin in the House of Delegates â that last only after a random drawing decided a tied election in District 94. These General Assembly elections will be the only ones conducted using the district maps chosen by a panel of federal judges in January, after ruling last year that lawmakers had racially gerrymandered 11 House districts by packing black voters into them.âTHE RULEBOOK: BETTER NOTÂ \\nâEvery view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management.â âÂ Alexander Hamilton,Â Federalist No. 23TIME OUT: âTOO MODERN FOR ITS TIMEâAtlantic: âKarolina Pavlova, born in 1807, wasnât a woman who acted in accordance with social norms. The leader of a respected Moscow literary salon, she was also devoutly committed to her own writing. That trait was greeted with animosity from many of her male contemporaries, who disparaged her readiness to share her work as unwomanly and approached her soaringly emotive poetry with suspicion. Even so, Pavlovaâs novelÂ A Double LifeÂ shook the Russian literary world when it was published in 1848, earning widespread praise for its revolutionary form and psychological acuity. Pavlova had written a book depicting a womanâs struggle against social constraints, andâa full half century beforeÂ FreudÂ popularized the idea of the subconsciousâinsisting on the independence of the unconscious mind.Â â¦Barbara HeldtÂ [translated] and released [a new edition] this yearâ¦ Pavlova constructed a strikingly prescient psychological vision: a mind responding to extreme social pressure by slowly and completely separating itself into parts, but giving few external indications of change.âFlag on the play? -Â Email us atÂ HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COMÂ with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKINGBiden:Â 28.2 points (âÂ 0.6 points from last wk.)Warren:Â 21.4 points (â 3.4 points from last wk.)Sanders:Â 16.2 points (âÂ 1.6 pointsÂ from last wk.)Buttigieg:Â 7.8 points (âÂ 1.4 points from last wk.)Harris:Â 2.8 points (âÂ 2 pointsÂ from last wk.)Yang:Â 2.8 points (â 0.8 points from last wk.)Klobuchar:Â 2.8 points (â 0.8 points from last wk.)\\n[Averages include: NBC News/WSJ, ABC News/WaPo, Fox News, IBD and USA Today/Suffolk University.]\\n[Ed. note: Weâre only tracking the top five Democratic candidates but, lo and behold, today we have a three-way tie for fifth place.

       "      <td>Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says aid was withheld due to concerns of corruption in Ukraine and concerns that European nations weren't contributing their fair share; Kristin Fisher reports.\\nHouse committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump have requested that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appear before the panels for a deposition on Friday, claiming that he was âdirectly involvedâ in the Ukraine controversy which sparked the proceedings.\\nHouse Intelligence Committee ChairÂ Adam Schiff, Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel penned a letter to Mulvaney on Tuesday, requesting his appearance at a deposition as part of the impeachment inquiry this Friday at 9 a.m.\\nNEW DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED\\nâBased on evidence gathered in the impeachment inquiry and public reporting, we believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the Houseâs impeachment inquiry,â they wrote.\\nâSpecifically, the investigation has revealed that you may have been directly involved in an effort orchestrated by President Trump, his personal agent, Rudolph Giuliani, and others to withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trumpâs personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so,â they continued.\\nThe request for Mulvaneyâs deposition comes amid the Houseâs formal impeachment inquiry into the president. The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky toÂ investigateÂ former Vice President Joe Biden and hisÂ son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\\nA transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\\nIn the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced âevidence,â such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaneyâs role in Trumpâs conversations with Zelensky.\\nââ¦Bolton told a National Security Council staffer âto notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaneyâ Â to pressure Ukraine for political help,â they wrote.\\nâAmbassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the Presidentâs scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, âI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,ââ they wrote. âThe âdrug dealâ appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.â\\nThe chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing âa central roleâ in the presidentâs move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.\\nâYou admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the Presidentâs own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,â they wrote.\\nDuring a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White Houseâs position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\\nâWe do that all the time with foreign policy,â Mulvaney said. âAnd I have news for everybody: Get over it. Thereâs going to be political influence in foreign policy.â\\nMulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.\\nâDespite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trumpâs order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the Presidentâs 2020 re-election campaign,â they wrote.\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\\nFox News' Chad Pergram and John Roberts contributed to this report.Â \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Democrats release hundreds of pages of testimony from Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill.\\nFormer U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, according to transcripts released Tuesday, pushed back on the claim that President Trump sought to withhold a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Kiev committed to investigate allegations concerning the 2016 election -- while also denying that Trump was seeking âdirtâ on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe deposition transcripts, though, also reflect officials' concerns about the involvement of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in seeking politically related investigations out of Ukraine. Further, they offer varying accounts of whether a quid pro quo of some kind -- involving either a meeting or the release of U.S. military aid -- may have been presented.\\nOne of the most significant revelations from Tuesday's release is that E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement -- a revelation that was quickly hailed by Democrats of proof of the quid pro quo they have been alleging took place.\\nOther sections presented a muddier picture.Â In theÂ transcript of his closed-door deposition last month with lawmakers conducting the impeachment probe, Volker was asked if Trump withheld or delayed a meeting with Zelensky absent a pledge to probe concerns Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\nGIULIANI SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE DEMS FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\\nâThe answer to the question is no, if you want a yes-or-no answer. But the reason the answer is no is we did have difficulty scheduling a meeting, but there was no linkage like that,â he said.\\nRecently revealed text messages showed Volker appearing to link the investigations to a D.C. visit by Zelensky. The deposition transcript seems to reflect Volker asserting the contrary. Sondland, too, testifying about a conversation he had with White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, saidÂ he didn't tell him the investigations were needed in order for there to be a White House visit.\\n\"That was never linked,\" he said.Â \"That was only specifically brought into the press statement for a brief period of time through Mr. Giuliani when we were negotiating a press statement.\"\\nAt another point in the transcript, though,Â Sondland said he eventually thought \"there might be a link between the White House visit and aid to the Ukraine that was being held up.\"\\nHouse Democrats established theÂ impeachment inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding President Trumpâs July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged him to âlook intoâ allegations surrounding the 2016 election and the Biden familyâs activities in the country. Democrats have alleged that a quid pro quo took place, with Trump leveraging military aid until the Ukrainians investigated the claims. Trump and Zelensky have claimed that no pressure was placed on them, but statements from certain officials have challenged that narrative.\\nWhile the White House released the transcript of the call, and a House committee released the original complaint by the whistleblower that sparked the process, much of the inquiry is now focusing on what officials understood to be the presidentâs intent at the time. While military aid was initially locked, it was eventually unblocked by Congress.\\nActing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor recently testified that he understood the White House was willing to hold up both military aid and a prospective White House meeting to extract a public announcement from the country that probes were underway.\\nUS ENVOY SONDLAND WORKED WITH GIULIANI ON UKRAINE CORRUPTION STATEMENT, VOLKER TESTIFIED: SOURCES\\nâBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,â Taylor testified, referring to Burisma Holdings -- a Ukrainian energy firm where Joe Bidenâs son Hunter sat on the board. A transcript of the July call shows Trump sought an investigation concerning Joe Bidenâs involvement in seeking the ouster of a prosecutor looking into that firm.\\nYet while Sondland had texted Taylor in September saying there was no quid pro quo, the transcripts released Tuesday of his deposition include a supplemental declaration, in which he says that âby the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.â\\nHe also acknowledged telling one of Zelenskyâs advisers that âresumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.â\\nIn a statement released Tuesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham still said the transcripts show lessÂ evidence for the \"illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought.\" She noted that Sondland said he \"presumed\"Â there was a link to the aidâ\"but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption.\"\\nIn another excerpt from the testimony, Sondland describedÂ how the discussions about a statement on corruption in general in Ukraine became more explicitly about Biden-Burisma as a \"continuum\" amid the involvement of Giuliani, who was pushing the Biden-Burisma agenda.\\n\"It keptâit kept getting more insidious as [the] timeline went on, and back in July, it was all about just corruption,\" he said.\\nSeparately he told lawmakers that Trump repeatedly urged Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to talk to Giuliani.\\n\"He didnât even -- he wasnât even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying: 'Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,'\" he said.\\nVolker too spoke about Giuliani's involvement,Â telling lawmakers that \"the negative narrative about Ukraine which Mr. Giuliani was furthering was the problem.\"\\nDemocrats seized on the testimony as proof of a quid pro quo, saying it was a sign that \"the president's scheme comes into clearer focus.\"\\nâIt is clear from their testimony that, in exchange for the statement, President Trump would award the Ukrainian president with a highly coveted White House meeting and, later, with millions of dollars in critical military aid being withheld,\" the statement from the chairs of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees said.Â \"Ambassador Sondland called this changing U.S. policy toward Ukraine a âcontinuumâ that became ever more âinsidiousâ over time.\"\\nDIPLOMAT BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES TRUMP USED UKRAINE AID, WHITE HOUSE MEETING AS LEVERAGE FOR PROBES\\nTheÂ statement from Sondland contrasts with his texts withÂ Taylor, who had expressed concern about what he saw as a quid pro quo.\\n\"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said in a text exchange in September.\\nâThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quoâs of any kind,â Sondland texted back. âThe President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.â\\nSondland, though, explained to the committeesÂ that Trump said something similar to him during a phone call, in which he said Trump was in a \"bad mood\" and nearly hung up on him.\\n\"I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,\" Trump said, according to Sondland. \"I want Zelensky to do the right thing.\"\\nVolker, meanwhile, on the morning of a planned July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, seemed to link a White House visit with the investigations, despite his more r...</td>\n",

Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counselâs office.Â A segment on Rachel Maddowâs MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled \"Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy.\"Â Maddow cited Menashiâs use of the term âethnonationalismâ to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on theÂ âfringe of racial thinking.â\\nDuring questioning, Sen.Â Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that MenashiÂ had faced âunusually personalâ and âviciousâ attacks.\\nMenashi denied the allegations, saying, âItâs hurtful and I think it misrepresents what Iâve written.â\\nDuring his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on âconstitutional traditions.\"\\nMenashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.\\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as âWell Qualified,â its highest mark.\\nThe ABAâs rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a âNot Qualifiedâ rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\\nThe ABAâs letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigantsÂ and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had runÂ against VanDyke for a judicial position.\\nAdditionally, multiple people who were interviewed by the ABA for VanDykeâs evaluation told Fox News that they gave positive reviews and were surprised by the ABAâs findings.\\nAddressing the accusations in the ABAâs letter, specifically his supposed stance towards the LGBTQ community, VanDyke broke down in tears in the middle of his hearing, denying the allegation.\\nâNo, I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God. They should all be treated with dignity and respect,â he said.\\nDespite opposition from the left, Trumpâs picks are likely to be confirmed due to the Senateâs Republican majority. \\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nMike Davis, president of The Article III Project, which works to help secure the confirmation of Trumpâs picks, noted that the presidentâs success in this area fulfills one of his 2016 campaign promises.\\nâPresident Trump has delivered on his promise to American voters,â Davis said, pointing to Trumpâs appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, âand an all-time-record number of circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals.â\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Even Democrats are taking notice of the estimated price tag. Dr. Vin Gupta weighs in.\\nAs \"Medicare-for-all\" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary,Â a new report released by the British government on itsÂ National Health Service, or NHS,Â offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.\\nThe reportÂ on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, detailsÂ increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visitsÂ to cancer care.Â And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.\\n\"Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,\" the report also declares.\\nAn American \"Medicare-for-all\" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system.Â Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.\\nBut the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range ofÂ Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth WarrenÂ haveÂ captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.\\nCritics in the United States have saidÂ that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.\\n\"Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'\" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday.Â \"Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.'Â But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?\\n\"Thereâs a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren wonât admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.\"\\nThe reportÂ on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standardsÂ in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.\\n\"In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,\" the report says of cancer wait times. \"During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded. The target of 85% has been missed for all but one month since April 2014.\"\\n\\n      A chart from the British House of Commons shows increased wait times for \"accident and emergency\" care in English hospitals over time.\\n      (House of Commons)\\nWARREN UNDER FIRE ON 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' AS SHE NOW CLAIMS BILLIONAIRES ALONE CAN FUND IT\\nPatients whose general practitioner refers them to a consultant, the report continues, are also waiting longer.\\nWhile the report is largely negative, it notes some positive indicators -- including an increase in the number of doctors and nurses in recent years.\\nThe British NHS provides health care for all for no cost at the point of delivery, which isÂ similar to what Sanders and Warren aim for with \"Medicare-for-all.\" It is funded through general taxation, meaning every taxpayer chips in to fund the program.\\n\\n      A surgical team prepare a patient ahead of performing an operation at Milton Keynes University Hospital in Milton Keynes, central England, Britain, May 23, 2018.

       "      <td>Talk radio host Dana Loesch argues 2020 White House hopeful Julian Castro is a 'hypocrite' on the subject after his remarks on gun control at the Democrat primary debate.\\nMANCHESTER, N.H. â Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro is laying off his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two of the first four early-voting states in the primary and caucus nominating season.\\nThe former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing secretary in then-President Barack Obamaâs cabinet will now focus his campaign on Iowa, which kicks off the nominating calendar, and Nevada, which votes third. The news â first reported by Politico â was confirmed early Tuesday by Fox News with a source close to the Castro campaign. The small staffs in both New Hampshire and South Carolina were notified on Monday.\\nCASTRO REACHES FUNDRAISING GOAL, STAYING IN 2020 RACE\\nThe move by the Castro campaign comes just a few days after it announced on Friday that it brought in $800,000 in the last 10 days of October, a haul Castro had said was necessary to continue his uphill bid for the Democratic nomination.\\nBut reaching that goal didnât erase the steep fundraising hurdles facing the campaign. Castro, who launched his longshot bid last December, has frequently spotlighted his underdog status as he runs for the nomination against many much better-known and better-funded rivals.\\nCastro made the stage for the first four rounds of Democratic presidential primary debates, but has yet to qualify for the fifth round, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia. The candidate has reached the individual donor threshold but remains short of reaching the polling criteria.\\nIn a fundraising email on Monday, CastroÂ campaign officials warned that their candidate was in jeopardy of not making the debate stage and said that they were âlaunching IMMEDIATE digital adsâ to help them clinch âthe final polls Julian needs to qualify.â\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\nCastro, the only Latino among the major Democratic White House hopefuls, will now pour his remaining resources into Iowa â where he launches a five-figure ad buy on Tuesday â and Nevada. Heâll also concentrate on his native Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, directly after the early voting states. The other Texan in the nomination race,Â former Rep. Beto OâRourke,Â ended his White House bid on Friday. \\nCastro raised roughly $3.5 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, but spent nearly $4 million in the same period. Castro has just $670,000 cash on hand at the start of October, but raised $1 million last month.\\n\\n      Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro signs the famed wooden eggs as he headlines 'Politics and Eggs' at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, NH in January, 2019\\n      \\nEyebrows were raised in New Hampshire in recent days as Castroâs campaign had yet to schedule a date for their candidate to file in person to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. The source close to the campaign said it was unclear if Castro would file in person.\\nKAMALA HARRIS LAYS OFF STAFF, SHUTS OFFICES, IN NH\\nThe move by Castro follows a similar step made last week by Sen. Kamala Harris. The California Democrat, hemorrhaging campaign cash, dramatically cut her staff in New Hampshire and closed all of her field offices in the first primary state, as she continues to concentrate all of her resources on Iowa.\\n</td>\n",

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said that Mexico is \"dangerously closeÂ to being a failed state.\"\\n\"This is what happens when Mexicoâs politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power. Enough. Mexicoâs president hasnât taken the threat seriously and innocent American lives have been lost again. The Mexican government must partner with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to wage a full-scale offensive against these butchers,â he said.\\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose own father was born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, also extended his condolences for the victims and called for the U.S. to get involved.\\nâOur prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy.

new restrictions on when police can inquire about immigration status or cooperate with federal law enforcement.\\n\\n      Tucson voters will decide Tuesday whether to declare itself a sanctuary

explicitly aims to neuter SB1070, a 2010 Arizona immigration law that drew mass protests and a boycott of Arizona. SB1070 prohibits sanctuary cities in Arizona and requires police to verify the immigration status of anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant.

The result of the showdown in Kentucky -- as well as Tuesday's gubernatorial race in Mississippi and state legislature races in Virginia -- could serve as a barometer this week on whether Trump still has the ability to rally Republicans at the voting booth amid Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats have acknowledged that Trump's influence helped the GOP sweep key House special elections in North Carolina in September. Amid chants of âUSAâ at Monday's rally, Trump repeatedly sought to leverage his accomplishments in office, including energy independence and historically low unemployment rates, to boost Gov.Â Matt Bevin.âTrump: Bevin âa pain in the ass,â but worth a second term -Â Lexington Herald Leader: âPresident Donald Trump gave Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin a Trumpian endorsement Monday night, just hours before Kentuckians go to the polls to decide if theyâll elect the Republican governor to a second term. âHeâs such a pain in the ass,â Trump said of Bevin. âBut isnât that what you want?â It was a backhanded compliment meant to highlight how hard Bevin works for Kentucky, but it also called attention to the governorâs biggest political weakness: his penchant for making controversial remarks that alienate friends and foes alike. â¦Â The event, though, has huge importance for Bevin, who is locked in a tight race with DemocratÂ Andy Beshear, the attorney general. Bevin has tied himself tightly to the president as he attempts to win back support after waging a public battle with teachers over their pension system.âUnusually close race in Mississippi -Â AP: âMississippiâs most competitive governorâs race in years was in the hands of voters Tuesday as Attorney GeneralÂ Jim HoodÂ sought to become the second Democratic governor in the Deep South. Heâs facing Republican Lt. Gov.Â Tate Reeves, who got campaign help in Mississippi from both President Donald Trump and Vice PresidentÂ Mike Pence. Hood, Reeves and two lesser-known candidates are on Tuesdayâs ballot. The winner will succeed term-limited Republican Gov.Â Phil Bryant. Democrats see Hood as their strongest nominee in nearly a generation in a conservative state where Republicans have been governor for 24 of the past 28 years.âRepublican majorities on the line in Old Dominion -Â WTOP: âVirginians are going to the polls Tuesday to cast votes in local elections as well as General Assembly races that could change the composition of both chambers of the stateâs legislature, while several D.C.-area towns in Maryland hold elections for mayor and council. In Virginia, the Republicans control both houses by the narrowest of margins. They hold a 21-19 advantage in the Senate and a 51-49 margin in the House of Delegates â that last only after a random drawing decided a tied election in District 94. These General Assembly elections will be the only ones conducted using the district maps chosen by a panel of federal judges in January, after ruling last year that lawmakers had racially gerrymandered 11 House districts by packing black voters into them.âTHE RULEBOOK: BETTER NOTÂ \\nâEvery view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management.â âÂ Alexander Hamilton,Â Federalist No. 23TIME OUT: âTOO MODERN FOR ITS TIMEâAtlantic: âKarolina Pavlova, born in 1807, wasnât a woman who acted in accordance with social norms. The leader of a respected Moscow literary salon, she was also devoutly committed to her own writing. That trait was greeted with animosity from many of her male contemporaries, who disparaged her readiness to share her work as unwomanly and approached her soaringly emotive poetry with suspicion. Even so, Pavlovaâs novelÂ A Double LifeÂ shook the Russian literary world when it was published in 1848, earning widespread praise for its revolutionary form and psychological acuity. Pavlova had written a book depicting a womanâs struggle against social constraints, andâa full half century beforeÂ FreudÂ popularized the idea of the subconsciousâinsisting on the independence of the unconscious mind.Â â¦Barbara HeldtÂ [translated] and released [a new edition] this yearâ¦ Pavlova constructed a strikingly prescient psychological vision: a mind responding to extreme social pressure by slowly and completely separating itself into parts, but giving few external indications of change.âFlag on the play? -Â Email us atÂ HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COMÂ with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKINGBiden:Â 28.2 points (âÂ 0.6 points from last wk.)Warren:Â 21.4 points (â 3.4 points from last wk.)Sanders:Â 16.2 points (âÂ 1.6 pointsÂ from last wk.)Buttigieg:Â 7.8 points (âÂ 1.4 points from last wk.)Harris:Â 2.8 points (âÂ 2 pointsÂ from last wk.)Yang:Â 2.8 points (â 0.8 points from last wk.)Klobuchar:Â 2.8 points (â 0.8 points from last wk.)\\n[Averages include: NBC News/WSJ, ABC News/WaPo, Fox News, IBD and USA Today/Suffolk University.]\\n[Ed. note: Weâre only tracking the top five Democratic candidates but, lo and behold, today we have a three-way tie for fifth place.

But among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of Trump, he receives no more than 7 percent support. Former vice presidentÂ Joe Biden, Sen.Â Bernie SandersÂ (I-Vt.) and Sen.Â Elizabeth WarrenÂ (D-Mass.) run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent).

The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky toÂ investigateÂ former Vice President Joe Biden and hisÂ son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\\nA transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\\nIn the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced âevidence,â such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaneyâs role in Trumpâs conversations with Zelensky.\\nââ¦Bolton told a National Security Council staffer âto notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaneyâ Â to pressure Ukraine for political help,â they wrote.\\nâAmbassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the Presidentâs scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, âI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,ââ they wrote. âThe âdrug dealâ appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.â\\nThe chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing âa central roleâ in the presidentâs move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.\\nâYou admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the Presidentâs own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,â they wrote.\\nDuring a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White Houseâs position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\\nâWe do that all the time with foreign policy,â Mulvaney said. âAnd I have news for everybody: Get over it. Thereâs going to be political influence in foreign policy.â\\nMulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.\\nâDespite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trumpâs order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the Presidentâs 2020 re-election campaign,â they wrote.\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\\nFox News' Chad Pergram and John Roberts contributed to this report.Â \\n  \n",
       "4  Democrats release hundreds of pages of testimony from Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill.\\nFormer U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, according to transcripts released Tuesday, pushed back on the claim that President Trump sought to withhold a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Kiev committed to investigate allegations concerning the 2016 election -- while also denying that Trump was seeking âdirtâ on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe deposition transcripts, though, also reflect officials' concerns about the involvement of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in seeking politically related investigations out of Ukraine. Further, they offer varying accounts of whether a quid pro quo of some kind -- involving either a meeting or the release of U.S. military aid -- may have been presented.\\nOne of the most significant revelations from Tuesday's release is that E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement -- a revelation that was quickly hailed by Democrats of proof of the quid pro quo they have been alleging took place.\\nOther sections presented a muddier picture.Â In theÂ transcript of his closed-door deposition last month with lawmakers conducting the impeachment probe, Volker was asked if Trump withheld or delayed a meeting with Zelensky absent a pledge to probe concerns Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\nGIULIANI SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE DEMS FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\\nâThe answer to the question is no, if you want a yes-or-no answer. But the reason the answer is no is we did have difficulty scheduling a meeting, but there was no linkage like that,â he said.\\nRecently revealed text messages showed Volker appearing to link the investigations to a D.C. visit by Zelensky. The deposition transcript seems to reflect Volker asserting the contrary. Sondland, too, testifying about a conversation he had with White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, saidÂ he didn't tell him the investigations were needed in order for there to be a White House visit.\\n\"That was never linked,\" he said.Â \"That was only specifically brought into the press statement for a brief period of time through Mr. Giuliani when we were negotiating a press statement.\"\\nAt another point in the transcript, though,Â Sondland said he eventually thought \"there might be a link between the White House visit and aid to the Ukraine that was being held up.\"\\nHouse Democrats established theÂ impeachment inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding President Trumpâs July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged him to âlook intoâ allegations surrounding the 2016 election and the Biden familyâs activities in the country. Democrats have alleged that a quid pro quo took place, with Trump leveraging military aid until the Ukrainians investigated the claims. Trump and Zelensky have claimed that no pressure was placed on them, but statements from certain officials have challenged that narrative.\\nWhile the White House released the transcript of the call, and a House committee released the original complaint by the whistleblower that sparked the process, much of the inquiry is now focusing on what officials understood to be the presidentâs intent at the time. While military aid was initially locked, it was eventually unblocked by Congress.\\nActing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor recently testified that he understood the White House was willing to hold up both military aid and a prospective White House meeting to extract a public announcement from the country that probes were underway.\\nUS ENVOY SONDLAND WORKED WITH GIULIANI ON UKRAINE CORRUPTION STATEMENT, VOLKER TESTIFIED: SOURCES\\nâBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,â Taylor testified, referring to Burisma Holdings -- a Ukrainian energy firm where Joe Bidenâs son Hunter sat on the board. A transcript of the July call shows Trump sought an investigation concerning Joe Bidenâs involvement in seeking the ouster of a prosecutor looking into that firm.\\nYet while Sondland had texted Taylor in September saying there was no quid pro quo, the transcripts released Tuesday of his deposition include a supplemental declaration, in which he says that âby the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.â\\nHe also acknowledged telling one of Zelenskyâs advisers that âresumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.â\\nIn a statement released Tuesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham still said the transcripts show lessÂ evidence for the \"illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought.\" She noted that Sondland said he \"presumed\"Â there was a link to the aidâ\"but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption.\"\\nIn another excerpt from the testimony, Sondland describedÂ how the discussions about a statement on corruption in general in Ukraine became more explicitly about Biden-Burisma as a \"continuum\" amid the involvement of Giuliani, who was pushing the Biden-Burisma agenda.\\n\"It keptâit kept getting more insidious as [the] timeline went on, and back in July, it was all about just corruption,\" he said.\\nSeparately he told lawmakers that Trump repeatedly urged Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to talk to Giuliani.\\n\"He didnât even -- he wasnât even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about.

With several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees could soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench.\\nPresident Trump is on his way to reaching a significant mark in his presidency, asÂ his latest nominees for federal appeals courtsÂ go through the confirmation process.\\nWith several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees couldÂ soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench. Out of 179 Circuit Court positions, 43 are occupied by Trump picks, with four current vacancies and another five spots opening up due to upcoming retirements.\\nTRUMP JUDICIAL PICK BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AT HEARING OVER LEGAL GROUPâS ATTACK\\nâThis is an exciting milestone for the president,â Judicial Crisis Network policy director Carrie Severino told Fox News.\\nWhile a number of Trumpâs picks are filling seats previously held by judges appointed by Republican presidents, many are taking the place of liberal jurists appointed by Democrats. The Ninth Circuit, for example, once known as a staunchly liberal Court of Appeals, is gradually evening out. Trump has already placed six judges on the Ninth Circuit bench, which currently has one vacancy and will have two more in the near future.\\nShould Trump fill all three spots, he will have chosen nearly a third of the roster with nine out of 29 judges.\\nSeverino described Trumpâs appellate nominees as âexceptional,â while stressing their independence.\\nâThatâs the kind of judge America wants,â Severino said, claiming that the ability to select judges for lifetime positions is a significant part of why Trump was elected in 2016.\\nTRUMP NOMINATES WAVE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES, IN FRESH BID TO RESHAPE COURTS\\nDemocrats have been fierce in their opposition to several of Trumpâs selections. Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counselâs office.Â A segment on Rachel Maddowâs MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled \"Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy.\"Â Maddow cited Menashiâs use of the term âethnonationalismâ to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on theÂ âfringe of racial thinking.â\\nDuring questioning, Sen.Â Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that MenashiÂ had faced âunusually personalâ and âviciousâ attacks.\\nMenashi denied the allegations, saying, âItâs hurtful and I think it misrepresents what Iâve written.â\\nDuring his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on âconstitutional traditions.\"\\nMenashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.\\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as âWell Qualified,â its highest mark.\\nThe ABAâs rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a âNot Qualifiedâ rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\\nThe ABAâs letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigantsÂ and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had runÂ against VanDyke for a judicial position.\\nAdditionally, multiple people who were interviewed by the ABA for VanDykeâs evaluation told Fox News that they gave positive reviews and were surprised by the ABAâs findings.\\nAddressing the accusations in the ABAâs letter, specifically his supposed stance towards the LGBTQ community, VanDyke broke down in tears in the middle of his hearing, denying the allegation.\\nâNo, I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God. They should all be treated with dignity and respect,â he said.\\nDespite opposition from the left, Trumpâs picks are likely to be confirmed due to the Senateâs Republican majority. \\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nMike Davis, president of The Article III Project, which works to help secure the confirmation of Trumpâs picks, noted that the presidentâs success in this area fulfills one of his 2016 campaign promises.\\nâPresident Trump has delivered on his promise to American voters,â Davis said, pointing to Trumpâs appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, âand an all-time-record number of circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals.â\\n  \n",

Dr. Vin Gupta weighs in.\\nAs \"Medicare-for-all\" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary,Â a new report released by the British government on itsÂ National Health Service, or NHS,Â offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.\\nThe reportÂ on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, detailsÂ increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visitsÂ to cancer care.Â And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.\\n\"Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,\" the report also declares.\\nAn American \"Medicare-for-all\" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system.Â Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.\\nBut the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range ofÂ Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth WarrenÂ haveÂ captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.\\nCritics in the United States have saidÂ that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.\\n\"Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'\" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday.Â \"Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.'Â But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?\\n\"Thereâs a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren wonât admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.\"\\nThe reportÂ on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standardsÂ in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.\\n\"In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,\" the report says of cancer wait times. \"During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded. The target of 85% has been missed for all but one month since April 2014.\"\\n\\n      A chart from the British House of Commons shows increased wait times for \"accident and emergency\" care in English hospitals over time.\\n      (House of Commons)\\nWARREN UNDER FIRE ON 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' AS SHE NOW CLAIMS BILLIONAIRES ALONE CAN FUND IT\\nPatients whose general practitioner refers them to a consultant, the report continues, are also waiting longer.\\nWhile the report is largely negative, it notes some positive indicators -- including an increase in the number of doctors and nurses in recent years.\\nThe British NHS provides health care for all for no cost at the point of delivery, which isÂ similar to what Sanders and Warren aim for with \"Medicare-for-all.\" It is funded through general taxation, meaning every taxpayer chips in to fund the program.\\n\\n      A surgical team prepare a patient ahead of performing an operation at Milton Keynes University Hospital in Milton Keynes, central England, Britain, May 23, 2018.

Sims called the SCDP â[w]ithin minutes of realizing thisâ and access was disabled, according to Steyerâs campaign.\\nBut inÂ a story first reported by The Post and Courier of Charleston, officials from the SCDP and the Democratic National Committee said they actually intervened in Sims' attempt to export the data, which included thousands of voter contacts built up by Harris' campaign.\\n\"Our organizers and volunteers work incredibly hard, and as this story notes, our campaign âhas built a particularly extensive field organizing operation in South Carolina,ââ Ian Sams, the Harris campaignâs national press secretary, said in a tweet. âIt's unfortunate anyone would try to steal that work from our team.\"\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nSims was announced last month as Steyer's deputy state director in South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South.

                                                Talk radio host Dana Loesch argues 2020 White House hopeful Julian Castro is a 'hypocrite' on the subject after his remarks on gun control at the Democrat primary debate.\\nMANCHESTER, N.H. â Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro is laying off his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two of the first four early-voting states in the primary and caucus nominating season.\\nThe former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing secretary in then-President Barack Obamaâs cabinet will now focus his campaign on Iowa, which kicks off the nominating calendar, and Nevada, which votes third. The news â first reported by Politico â was confirmed early Tuesday by Fox News with a source close to the Castro campaign. The small staffs in both New Hampshire and South Carolina were notified on Monday.\\nCASTRO REACHES FUNDRAISING GOAL, STAYING IN 2020 RACE\\nThe move by the Castro campaign comes just a few days after it announced on Friday that it brought in $800,000 in the last 10 days of October, a haul Castro had said was necessary to continue his uphill bid for the Democratic nomination.\\nBut reaching that goal didnât erase the steep fundraising hurdles facing the campaign. Castro, who launched his longshot bid last December, has frequently spotlighted his underdog status as he runs for the nomination against many much better-known and better-funded rivals.\\nCastro made the stage for the first four rounds of Democratic presidential primary debates, but has yet to qualify for the fifth round, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia. The candidate has reached the individual donor threshold but remains short of reaching the polling criteria.\\nIn a fundraising email on Monday, CastroÂ campaign officials warned that their candidate was in jeopardy of not making the debate stage and said that they were âlaunching IMMEDIATE digital adsâ to help them clinch âthe final polls Julian needs to qualify.â\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\nCastro, the only Latino among the major Democratic White House hopefuls, will now pour his remaining resources into Iowa â where he launches a five-figure ad buy on Tuesday â and Nevada. Heâll also concentrate on his native Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, directly after the early voting states. The other Texan in the nomination race,Â former Rep. Beto OâRourke,Â ended his White House bid on Friday. \\nCastro raised roughly $3.5 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, but spent nearly $4 million in the same period. Castro has just $670,000 cash on hand at the start of October, but raised $1 million last month.\\n\\n      Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro signs the famed wooden eggs as he headlines 'Politics and Eggs' at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, NH in January, 2019\\n      \\nEyebrows were raised in New Hampshire in recent days as Castroâs campaign had yet to schedule a date for their candidate to file in person to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. The source close to the campaign said it was unclear if Castro would file in person.\\nKAMALA HARRIS LAYS OFF STAFF, SHUTS OFFICES, IN NH\\nThe move by Castro follows a similar step made last week by Sen.

OneÂ child is currently missing, and authorities are searching the mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border for the child.\\nThose attacked were members of the LeBaron family, a well-known American clan who hasÂ lived in the community in the northern part of the country for decades, according toÂ The New York Times.Â The attack targeted citizens who live in a community founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\n\"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,\" Trump tweeted. \"We merely await a call from your great new president!\"\\nPresident AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador refused that approach, however, saying at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\"\\n\"We declared war, and it didn't work,\" Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. \"That is not an option.\"\\nTrump has repeatedly raised concerns about levels of gang violence and drug-related crime in Mexico, particularly as it relates to securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The two countries have stepped up cooperation on that front over the summer, with asylum seekers being returned to Mexico to await hearings, while Mexico has also increased its troop presence on both its northern and southern borders.\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nEarly reports indicated the tragedy could have been a case of mistaken identity, but recent history also raises the possibility the LeBaron family was the intended target: only a decade ago, two members of the family opposed to local drug trafficking groups were kidnapped and murdered, according to the New York Times.\\nMexico's federal Department of Security and Citizens' Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area following \"the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people.\" The troops were searching for the missing community members, believed to include 11 children or more.\\nA number of Republicans backed Trump's call for action in Mexico in response to the massacre. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said that Mexico is \"dangerously closeÂ to being a failed state.\"\\n\"This is what happens when Mexicoâs politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power. Enough. Mexicoâs president hasnât taken the threat seriously and innocent American lives have been lost again. The Mexican government must partner with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to wage a full-scale offensive against these butchers,â he said.\\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose own father was born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, also extended his condolences for the victims and called for the U.S. to get involved.\\nâOur prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence,â he tweeted.\\nFox Newsâ Danielle Wallace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n  "

Under the sentence, Olsen is prohibited from working in law enforcement, possessing firearms or profiting from the case. \\nDear Jackson praised what she said was the strength, fortitude and compassion of the family of the victim, 26-year-old Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. She said she had also watched the defendant closely during the trial. \\n\"Many might have thought you were stoic and void of emotion,\" the judge told Olsen. \"From the time opening statements started, I saw the tears that you\\'ve had. I saw how you replayed March 9, 2015, in your head.\" \\nProsecutors had asked the court for a 25-year sentence with five years probation. \\nA jury last month acquitted Olsen of murder in the March 2015 death of Hill but found him guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath.\\nJurors deliberated for more than a week. Olsen had faced up to 35 years in prison.\\nBefore sentencing, the court heard from Hill\\'s mother, father and sister.\\n\"The decision Robert Olsen made that day changed my life forever,\" said his mother, Carolyn Baylor Giummo. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\\nShe remembered her son as a compassionate child, a talented choir singer and student-athlete whose life seemed to change after his deployment to Afghanistan.   \\n\"He didn\\'t come back unscathed,\" she said. At the time of the shooting, Hill had had stopped taking his medications because of side effects and suffered a breakdown, she said. \\nGiummo recalled her father always telling her and his grandchildren that \"if you\\'re ever in trouble, run to the police.\"\\n\"The jury may have found Mr. Robert Olsen not guilty of murder but he still killed my son,\" she told the court. \"He has never taken responsibility for taking my son\\'s life. He\\'s never just said, \\'I\\'m sorry for killing Tony.\\'\"\\n Anthony Hill, Sr., said he felt as if he had failed as a father for not protecting his son. He lamented that the defendant never once looked him in the eye with an expression of remorse. \\n\"I stood out in that passageway many a day just hoping to make a little bit of eye contact,\" he said. \"Not one time would he look my way.\"\\nOlsen\\'s wife, Catherine, read a statement in court. She said one of the few times she saw her husband break down emotionally was after he killed Hill. \\n\"He was mourning for the individual whose life he had taken,\" she said, adding that she and Olsen recognize the pain of Hill\\'s family. \\n\"I cannot imagine how hard this had been for his parents and family,\" she said.  \\nCatherine Olsen was overcome by emotion as her husband was taken away by officers after the sentencing.\\nOlsen did not address the court.\\nBefore the shooting, someone in Hill\\'s neighborhood called police to report a man was \"acting deranged, knocking on doors, and crawling around on the ground naked,\" then-DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said then.\\nOlsen was dispatched, and \"when (Hill) saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer. The officer called him to stop while stepping backwards, drew his weapon and fired two shots,\" Alexander said.\\nDefense attorney Amanda Clark Palmer said Olsen, who worked for the DeKalb County police, was \"a good cop who had to make a tough decision.\"\\nHill\\'s girlfriend previously said he had a history of mental illness and struggled to get the support he needed from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had stopped taking his medication shortly before his death, she said. \\nDuring closing arguments, the prosecution claimed Olsen did not follow protocol for using force. Assistant District Attorney Lance Cross said Olsen could have used a baton on Hill.\\n')\n",

Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state\\'s popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as \"leans Republican\" -- the state\\'s unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. \\nA candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi\\'s 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nThe election process, as written in the state\\'s constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \\nCritics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday\\'s election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\\nThe provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\\nWhile Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\\n')\n",

But after trying THC cartridges, she began to experience health problems. On September 6, she died.\\nMary Kerrie\\'s case sounds like the nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related injury confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of this week, the outbreak has led to 37 vaping-related deaths in 24 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands.\\nMany of those cases and deaths were among people who vaped THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.\\n\"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC\\'s principal deputy director, told reporters in October. \"But I\\'d like to stress that we don\\'t know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or way that the devices are producing harm.\"\\nMary Kerrie\\'s death hasn\\'t yet been counted in the CDC\\'s total. Her grieving family has many questions still without answers. But they believe that vaping THC is what ultimately led to her death.\\nFrom smoking to vaping\\nWhen Mary Kerrie transitioned to vaping nicotine a few years ago, she stopped smoking cigarettes completely, her daughter, Maggie Davis, said. Mary Kerrie was adamant with family and friends that vaping was healthier than smoking.\\n\"She thought it was safer,\" her husband, Kevin Davis, said. \"I certainly liked the fact that there wasn\\'t the cigarette smell and her breath didn\\'t smell like cigarettes. I kind of thought it was better, too.\"\\nMaggie remembers that her mom came to California this summer to help her move into her dorm for her senior year of college. While there, Mary Kerrie went to a vape shop and purchased THC cartridges for the first time.\\nImmediately upon returning home, she developed a nagging cough. Kevin didn\\'t know Mary Kerrie had been vaping THC cartridges. Only after her death did the Davis family learn that Mary Kerrie had continued buying and using THC cartridges in Georgia. Unlike in California, THC is illegal in the Davis\\' home state.\\n\\'I hope you don\\'t have that vaping disease\\'\\nMary Kerrie experienced a steady decline in health between the time she started vaping THC cartridges and her death. The initial health effects she had experienced from vaping to quit smoking transitioned into frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a terrible cough. They\\'re all among the reported symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\nMary Kerrie went to the hospital for assessment on September 4. A flu swab tested negative. She texted her daughter that she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nMaggie had just begun hearing reports of a national outbreak of a mystery illness related to vaping. She texted her mom, \"I hope you don\\'t have that vaping disease.\"\\nOn the way home from the hospital, groaning between coughs, Mary Kerrie said, \"I\\'m never smoking again. I\\'m throwing out all of my e-cigarettes and weed pens,\" Maggie wrote in a personal essay for her college newspaper.\\nKevin, an OB/GYN, encouraged Mary Kerrie when she declared she was quitting it all.\\nStill, Mary Kerrie\\'s symptoms became worse over the next two days. She stayed home from social gatherings, telling her husband that she just needed rest.\\nHe felt she should be seen again by a doctor.\\nDays later, on September 6, Mary Kerrie was still sick. It was Kevin who found her, lips blue and gasping for breath, whispering, \"help.\"\\nOn the way to the hospital again, Mary Kerrie\\'s pulse was barely detectable. She\\'d become unresponsive.\\nAt the hospital, doctors performed CPR unsuccessfully.\\nMoments later, Mary Kerrie -- an outgoing 52-year-old who loved rollerskating and mountain biking, a mother and wife who was known for being vivacious and happy -- was gone.\\n\"She will never see her youngest daughter graduate high school, nor her oldest graduate college,\" Maggie wrote after her death. \"She will never see her daughters married or meet her grandchildren. Her absence, a sudden and jarring hole in my family, will be felt for decades to come.\"\\nIn X-rays on the day Mary Kerrie presented at the hospital, her lungs had looked clear. Two days later, they revealed a white substance resembling clouds infiltrating Mary Kerrie\\'s lungs.\\n\\'From healthy to drowning in your own lungs\\'\\nTo the Davis family, the X-rays seemed to confirm what they had heard in the news: Mary Kerrie\\'s illness wasn\\'t simply a case of pneumonia. In addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain, the whiteout in her lungs was one of the symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\n\"This wasn\\'t a nursing home patient. This wasn\\'t somebody with a chronic illness,\" Kevin said. \"You don\\'t just go from healthy to drowning in your own lungs and a flatline EKG from things in your daily life.\"\\nNearly two months after Mary Kerrie\\'s death, her case is still not part of the official CDC count of vaping-related lung injury deaths.\\nIn part, it speaks to just how new of a phenomenon this is. The ongoing investigation \"may take a few months\" and could yield \"multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\" CDC\\'s Schuchat told reporters early in October.\\nFor the Davis family, the wait has been frustrating. To them, it seems obvious that Mary Kerrie\\'s death is related to vaping.\\nKevin said he recently spoke with a CDC official who said that his wife\\'s case met the agency\\'s definition of a vaping-related illness, but the agency is waiting for the county medical examiner\\'s decision before making an announcement.\\nThere have already been three confirmed vaping-related deaths in Georgia. If and when it is announced, Mary Kerrie\\'s death could be the fourth, potentially making Georgia\\'s death count the highest in the United States.\\nMary Kerrie\\'s legacy\\nThe Davis family and Mary Kerrie\\'s friends want her to be remembered for the good she brought into their lives.\\n\"She was all in on me and all in on our daughters, all in on her family. Anything that she wanted to be a part of, it was everything for her,\" Kevin said of their 24-year marriage. \"Her energy is beautiful, and I sure miss her.\"\\nThe Davis family attributes part of the blame for Mary Kerrie\\'s death to a lack of regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration.\\n\"Marijuana pens also boast exponentially higher numbers of THC, and yet we still do not know how this historically disproportionate consumption of marijuana affects the human body, particularly when consumed as an oil,\" Maggie wrote.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA warned consumers to stop using THC vaping products as investigations into vaping-related lung injuries and deaths continue. Last week, the CDC made a similar warning, saying \"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC.\"\\n\"Mary Kerrie vaped [nicotine] products for several years I would say, successfully, and did quit smoking,\" Kevin said. \"I think when she was exposed to legal THC in California and then got illicit THC in Georgia ... I think that\\'s what killed her.\"\\n\"Other people, if they\\'re being exposed to something that can kill them, I hope they stop,\" Kevin said. \"I hope her passing helps somebody else.\"\\n')\n",

The meal included a hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and cookies. Some of the early Happy Meal toys included a McDoodler stencil, McWrist wallet and a spinning top.

Hasbro\\'s chief rival, Mattel (MAT), enjoyed a sales surge of 3% over the same period. Both toy companies\\' success was largely tied to Toys \"R\" Us prior to the retailer\\'s financial demise and rebirth.\\nThe revamped Toys \"R\" Us will open two streamlined locations ahead of Black Friday in Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and The Galleria in Houston.\\n\"We know that customers love shopping as a means of entertainment.

The ticketed attraction costs $20 for children ages 4-12 and $28 for adults. It features toy-themed play areas for small children who, the company hopes, will bug their parents to buy them merchandise associated with the fun zones they\\'ve just finished exploring. \\nThese pop-up playlands aren\\'t permanent stores. After about six months they will set up shop somewhere else.\\nGoodman, who previously served as CEO of The Gap (GPS), Kmart, and Sears, used a similar blueprint to help Candytopia founder Jackie Sorkin turn her birthday party and event business into a multi-million dollar, confection-themed touring attraction celebrated by celebrity influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore.\\nToys \"R\" Adventure\\'s first run in Chicago and Atlanta generated national headlines last week as families celebrated the return of the familiar retail brand.  Pictures and videos of smiling, laughing children walking through imitation snow caves and interacting with the Toys \"R\" Us mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, are circulating now on Instagram and Facebook.\\nThe Toys \"R\" Us Adventure in Atlanta\\'s Lenox Marketplace shopping complex was nearly filled to capacity, Goodman said. \\n\"We feel like we\\'re adding a service to the mall in terms of driving additional traffic, anything from 1,700 to 2,200 people every single day,\" Goodman told CNN Business. \"It\\'s like the circus.

The Rutherford, New Jersey shopping complex is less a place to buy consumer goods and more of an indoor theme park with cartoon-themed attractions in its Nickelodeon Universe. It also has an indoor ski slope, a water park, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink.\\nScott Webb, CEO of the digital consulting firm Avionos, says this may be the future of toy-related, brick-and-mortar retail shopping. Encouraging kids to play with toys that aren\\'t tied to TV, movie, or video game characters is crucial for the industry, which has struggled in an era when children binge watching shows on streaming services often avoid commercials advertising toys that they won\\'t see on their favorite shows.\\n\"Kids as much as anything are digital consumers now,\" Webb told CNN Business. \"The Hasbro numbers back this up. The segments of toys that have really thrived are those tied to some intellectual property, whether it\\'s Fortnite or Marvel or Star Wars.\" \\nWebb said Toys \"R\" Us turning its company into a toy discovery brand as opposed to a retailer may be a good strategy. \"I think they absolutely have a lot of brand equity to carve out a new niche in that role,\" he continued. \"But I think it would be hard to predict them ever discovering the same dominance in retail.\"\\n')\n",

But the real number, he said, is likely higher.\\n\"I think there\\'s a false belief that white children make up the biggest number of missing children when in fact (proportionally) it\\'s just the opposite,\" Lowery said, adding that the high number of black girls reported missing is particularly concerning.\\nHere are some reasons experts say we don\\'t hear more about missing children of color:\\nTheir families are hesitant to call police\\nSome families are hesitant to contact law enforcement, even if they think their child is missing.\\n\"There\\'s a sense of distrust between law enforcement and the minority community,\" said Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation.\\nThat distrust contributes to a \"silent code of \\'no snitching,\\'\" Wilson said, adding that it is important for people who suspect a child is missing to speak up.\\n\"It could be your child, your mother, your father that\\'s missing,\" she said. \"You would want someone to speak up to help find them.\"\\nOther families might not report that their child is missing because they fear it could have unintended, negative consequences. \\nFor example, Lowery suspects missing Latino children are underreported because some families with undocumented members might not contact police for fear of being deported. \\nThey don\\'t get as much media coverage\\nNews media organizations have often been criticized for not giving missing black children the amount of attention they give missing white kids. \\nA 2010 study found that black children were significantly underrepresented in TV news. Even though about a third of all missing children in the FBI\\'s database were black, they only made up about 20 percent of the missing children cases covered in the news. \\nA 2015 study was bleaker: though black children accounted for about 35% of missing children cases in the FBI\\'s database, they amounted to only 7% of media references.\\nExperts say media coverage is vital to helping solve those cases.\\n\"It puts law enforcement on alert, and they add additional resources to the case,\" Wilson said. \"If no one knows about it, then no one\\'s doing anything to find them or to help them get the assistance they need.\"\\nFamilies don\\'t have the resources\\nFamilies don\\'t always have the financial resources to respond appropriately when their child is missing. They might not be able to afford a private investigator or take off from work to help look for their child and follow up with law enforcement and the media. \\nAnd in some cases, they may not know what to do.\\nWilson said some people are under the misconception that they must wait 48 hours before filing a police report, when that waiting period varies by location. Places like Illinois or Washington, DC, don\\'t have waiting periods to report a child missing.\\nKnowing the laws in your state helps. And when in doubt, contact law enforcement immediately. \\nThere are other resources that families can utilize as well.\\nThe Black and Missing Foundation helps families of color file police reports, create missing posters and spread the word about missing children.\\nFacebook groups offer an online community for parents to alert the public about their missing child and ask questions of others who have had similar experiences. \\nEliseo Montoya, who runs the Facebook group Runaway and Missing Children in California, said he keeps the page going because it allows families to feel like they\\'re doing something even when it seems like authorities are giving up. \\n\"A page like mine is very important for people of color because nobody really embraces people of color,\" Montoya said.\\nSome get classified as runaways\\nWhen most people think of missing children, they think of young children abducted by strangers. But missing children can refer to kids who are abducted by relatives or children who leave home, either voluntarily or after being lured by someone else.\\nMany missing children of color are classified as runaways, Wilson said. And while running away from home isn\\'t a problem unique to nonwhite children, they are particularly vulnerable. \\nA significant number of nonwhite children who go missing are either homeless or in foster care, said Wilson, and many are at risk for sex trafficking. Data shows black children are overrepresented in foster care and are at a much higher risk for homelessness. \\nLaw enforcement often classify children of color as runaways without having all the details, Wilson said. Because those kids are considered to have voluntarily left home, Amber alerts aren\\'t sent out about them and they typically aren\\'t covered in the news. \\nRunaway cases and abductions by family members don\\'t get the same attention that abductions by non-family members or strangers do. But all these scenarios fall under the \"missing\" umbrella. A child is missing if they are under the age of 18 and their legal guardian doesn\\'t know where they are.\\nThe NCMEC no longer distinguishes between runaways and abductions on their posters of missing children.\\n\"Frankly, we were dealing with a desensitized public and media when we did that,\" Lowery said. \"Now if you check our website, our children are just listed as missing child.\"\\nWilson stressed that runaway cases should be treated with the same urgency.\\n\"We have to be mindful,\" she said. \"What did they leave from, and what are they ultimately running to?\"\\nSometimes, children of color get classified as runaways when they are truly missing. Wilson said her organization has seen many such cases. \\n\"We tell parents all the time, you know your child better than anyone else, their behavior, their characteristics,\" she said. \"If you believe your child did not run away, you just have to stand firm with law enforcement and let them know that this is uncharacteristic of your child.\" \\n')\n",

Which is why it\\'s hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what\\'s more chaotic that utter chaos?\\nThe answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\\nConsider what we\\'ve seen just since Friday:\\n1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President\\'s calling card\\n2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\\n3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \\n4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\\n5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\\n6. Roger Stone\\'s trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \\n7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton\\'s 33,000 deleted emails\\nAnd in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\\nThe rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There\\'s just so much going on.\\nAt one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can\\'t look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn\\'t, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\\nAnd the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\\nFrom a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \\nBut by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\\nEven for vast news organizations like CNN, it\\'s simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn\\'t even come close.\\nNow consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\\nThe real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won\\'t) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump\\'s constant content cavalcade?\\n')\n",

Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\\nWilliams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence\\'s office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president\\'s national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\\nPence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence\\'s daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\\nLawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams\\' thinking says she is able to do.\\nOver a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani\\'s efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\\nSince then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\\nThe three committees leading the Democrat\\'s inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nCurrent and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\\nThe official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces.

That will be on full display in Tuesday\\'s elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \\nKentucky\\'s Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday\\'s gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \\nYet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \\nIf Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \\nThe same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \\nThe polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \\nYou can\\'t help but think Trump\\'s standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \\nHood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \\nAfter the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \\nIf there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it\\'s likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \\nThose slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump\\'s running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There\\'s a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \\nWere Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\\nI would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don\\'t know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \\nStill, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\\n')\n",

The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. \\nAll eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates.\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: \\nKentucky governor \\nRepublican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state\\'s attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   \\nTrump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor\\'s office in the state. \\nTrump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin\\'s victory came within 10 points of his opponent.\\nMedicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.\\nIn 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\\nBeshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \\nPolls close at 6 p.m. local time. \\nMississippi governor\\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  \\nTrump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday\\'s election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor\\'s office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \\nCook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood\\'s appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\\nHood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \\nThere is an unusual aspect to the state\\'s election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi\\'s 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nVice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. \\nVirginia legislature \\nRepublicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats\\' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats\\' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\\nDemocrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\\nDemocrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.\\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.\\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET.\\n')\n",

And now it\\'s the President who is leading the attack. \\n\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he\\'s the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he\\'s the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he\\'s a Brennan guy, he\\'s a Susan Rice guy, he\\'s an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \\nHe\\'s been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\\nBut the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \\nThere are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower\\'s Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\\nWhen that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\\nKohn added: \"If I\\'m fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don\\'t go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\\nAnd Trump has made clear where he stands. \\nHe wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn\\'t gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\\n\"It\\'s a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it\\'s the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\\nBut certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower\\'s attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\\nThe whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\\nHarassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\\n\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\\nDevine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\\nHe ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\\nBut that wasn\\'t the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\\nAnd then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I\\'m an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\\nBut no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \\n\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\\nToobin called Trump\\'s actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\\n\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\\nBut that won\\'t help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\\nUltimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It\\'s much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\\n')\n",

They are also alleged to have aided Giuliani, the President\\'s personal attorney, in efforts to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe video of the rally is the latest example of how the pair who had little record of donations to candidates before 2018, wielded their proximity to Giuliani and used political donations to gain access to the president and political campaigns. Photos and videos throughout 2018 and 2019 show the pair traveling with the former New York City mayor throughout the world and to political events across the country.\\nThe footage was found by CNN\\'s KFile during a review of the travel and political activity of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman.\\nParnas and Fruman were arrested in October attempting to leave the country. They were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week to the charges. Parnas and Fruman were ordered to house confinement and subject to GPS monitoring after they each secured a $1 million bond. \\nIn the videos, Parnas sits in the area directly behind Trump before and during the rally.  Parnas, who at times is wearing a blue hat and glasses, can be seen apparently taking a video of the President on his cellphone as he walks up the stairs to the stage.\\nAt another point, Parnas leaves the area behind the podium to be along the path of the Trump\\'s exit at the bottom of the stage. He waves to the president as he leaves, and the president waves back in the direction of Parnas and the crowd.\\nIt is unclear how Parnas, who is not a Nevada native, got into the prized seating area directly behind the President. A photo from Parnas\\' Instagram featured in a video by the Wall Street Journal shows he appeared to have a VIP badge for the event.\\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman since their indictment.\\n\"I don\\'t know those gentlemen,\" the President said earlier this month. \"Now it\\'s possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know them,\" Trump added. \"I don\\'t know about them. I don\\'t know what they do but I don\\'t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You\\'d have to ask Rudy, I just don\\'t know.\"\\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman returned a request for comment. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. A lawyer for Fruman did not return a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. \\nRally mentioned in indictments\\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York described the October 2018 rally in the 21-page indictment of Parnas, Fruman and their associates David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were both indicted on a conspiracy charge. Correia and Kukushkin have also pleaded not guilty.\\nThe prosecutors wrote that \"on or about October 20, 2018,\" Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for \"Candidate-1\" in Nevada and took photos with \"Candidate-2.\" The trio then sent the photographs to \"Foreign National-1,\" whose identity has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe candidates were later identified as Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wesley Duncan. Trump appeared at the rally to campaign for Laxalt. A photo from Parnas\\' now-private Instagram, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal, shows him and Fruman posing for a photograph with Laxalt previously during a September 2018 fundraiser. A spokesperson for Laxalt told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he \"doesn\\'t know the man.\"\\nOne of several midterm events attended by Parnas and Fruman  \\nThe Trump rally in Nevada was one of many events attended by Fruman and Parnas in the final weeks heading up the November 2018 midterm elections.\\nIn photos posted on Twitter, Parnas and Fruman can be seen accompanying Giuliani to events in Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Indiana and again in Nevada.\\nA November 3, 2018, tweet of a several photos from Michigan Senate candidate John James shows James sitting at a table with Giuliani and Parnas. In another photo, James can be seen speaking while Fruman sits in the first row of seats and Parnas stand with Giuliani off to the side. \\nPictures tweeted that same day from Giuliani and congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian show Giuliani with Parnas and Fruman while campaigning in Nevada. A video from that morning also shows Fruman and Parnas with Giuliani as he campaigns in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun.\\nAnother campaign event for then-Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on November 4, 2018, shows Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman among attendees according to photos shared from DeSantis\\'s Twitter account.\\nParnas was also seen with Giuliani at campaign events for New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Eddie Edwards.

Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft\\'s, of course).\\nThe effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft\\'s 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company. \\nBy shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity. \\nThe initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — culture of overwork. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: karoshi means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.\\nThe issue attracted international attention in 2015, when an employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu committed suicide on Christmas Day.

Plans for the store were announced in September.\\nThe new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company\\'s vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want \"convenience,\\xa0comfort and connection\" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. \\nYoung said the store is meant to be \"predictable and effortless\" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. \\nThe store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe\\'s 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. \\nThe design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks\\' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.\\nCustomers aren\\'t required to order from Starbucks\\' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. \\nThe digitally focused store is part of the company\\'s goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. \\nStarbucks Pick-Up will help the company \"test and learn\" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.\\nThe new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That\\'s a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. \\nStarbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It\\'s similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. \\nCEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks\\' earnings call this week that it\\'s \"seeing encouraging early results\" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China\\'s largest cities. \\nBoth Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company\\'s portfolio of stores that are \"tuned to different needs at different times,\" Young said. \\nOn the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks\\'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world\\'s largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November.

But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple\\'s starting model, you\\'ll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple\\'s original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product. \\nIn a sense, this is Apple (AAPL) doing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones. \\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes, mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple\\'s rivals. It\\'s a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it\\'s become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple\\'s product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\\n Apple hasn\\'t shared how many AirPods it\\'s sold, but the company\\'s wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it\\'s hard not to believe it. \\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned, with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it\\'s tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it\\'s like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ. \\nFor those moments when you don\\'t want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people\\'s voices without sacrificing what you\\'re listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual\\'s ear canal\\'s shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud. \\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it\\'s still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem. \\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car. \\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I\\'d argue he\\'s right. AirPod loyalists are fanatical about the earbuds, and the love for them is about to get even deeper. \\nBuzz around the new Pro version will undoubtedly convince other Apple users to make a purchase, too. They\\'ll also soon know the pain and anguish of (almost) losing a fallen earpiece.\\n')\n",

Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \\nHere\\'s what Paul said:\\n\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, \\'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!\\'\"\\nPaul\\'s pledge echoes Trump\\'s attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\\nWhile that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It\\'s not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\\nWhat Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\\nThat\\'s not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\\nHere\\'s how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\\nThe task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what\\'s in the whistleblower\\'s complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\\nTo date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\\nFixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn\\'t on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\\nBut thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\\nWhat Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower\\'s account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\\nIt\\'s not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn\\'t come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it\\'s a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\\nTo which I say: Doesn\\'t matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn\\'t. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\\n')\n",

Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state\\'s Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\\nI asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\nCillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\\nBailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\\nBevin\\'s confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\\nGoforth\\'s campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn\\'t one of us and didn\\'t share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn\\'t the type of man you invite to grandma\\'s house for potato salad.\\nAttorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can\\'t take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\\nCillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\\nBailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump\\'s candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\\nBut there are some clear differences between the two. \\nThe President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\\nBevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country\\'s future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\\nCillizza: The national Democratic Party isn\\'t popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\\nBailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\\nAndy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he\\'s stopped controversial parts of Bevin\\'s agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\\nHe also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\\nCillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\\nBailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor\\'s accomplishments.\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\\nBailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\\nThe President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\\nTrump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\\n')\n",

You\\'re reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You\\'re read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\\nThat response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven\\'t we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\\nA bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\\nOn Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \\n\"If the media\\'s pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They\\'re wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi\\'s charade is backfiring!\".\\nAnd then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \\n\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats\\' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats\\' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\\nPresumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President\\'s standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\\nWhich is fine! And smart!\\n(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\\nBut if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \\nThink of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn\\'t exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\\nThat\\'s not to say Trump\\'s \"real\" polls don\\'t exist or even that they don\\'t show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can\\'t just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that\\'s out there.\\nAnd honestly, wouldn\\'t Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign\\'s best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\\nWhy haven\\'t they? I don\\'t know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\\nNo matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\\n')\n",

Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.\\nBut the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.\\nCastro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.\\n')\n",

The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\\nThe five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators\\' ability to pierce the administration\\'s shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump\\'s direct involvement in the case.\\nOLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\\nThe administration\\'s new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress\\' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn\\'t block the House\\'s pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\\nThe memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\\n')\n",

Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\\'s dealings with Ukraine.\\n\"I say to tonight to the media: do your job and print his name,\" Paul, a Kentucky Republican, yelled during a rally Trump held in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin ahead of Tuesday\\'s gubernatorial election. The crowd of Trump supporters, many donning \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT\" shirts, erupted into applause and cheers, and some chanted \"Do your job!\" and pointed toward the area where members of the press gathered to cover the event.\\nPaul told the crowd \"we also now know the name of the whistleblower,\" but did not provide any personal knowledge of the person\\'s identity, before going on to echo baseless claims of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \"The whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,\" Paul said. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\nSeveral other Republicans have called for the whistleblower\\'s identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator\\'s insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person\\'s identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\\nDuring the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\nThe anonymous whistleblower\\'s complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump\\'s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\\nOn Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client\\'s identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \\nZaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client\\'s identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee\\'s Democratic majority.\\nIn September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower\\'s identity have deepened.\\nTwo sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\\n\\'Deeply troubling and disappointing\\' \\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN\\'s John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator\\'s calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower\\'s complaint.\\n\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don\\'t care if it\\'s (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn\\'t matter because the investigation is \\'what happened?\\' This is a distraction,\" King said. \\n\"It\\'s deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \\nLater on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it\\'s \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\\nRaskin argued that the \"attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic\" that is a \"distraction from the merits of the case.\"\\n')\n",

But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn\\'t an easy lift and can\\'t snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \\nTalks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts\\' team over simple things like where Roberts\\' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn\\'t all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president\\'s room. \\nThat room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn\\'t likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\\nAnd, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\\n\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I\\'m) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\\nSenate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they\\'d typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.\\nSchumer\\'s office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House\\'s impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.\\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\\nSchumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\\nA key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren\\'t sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\\nThere is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year\\'s midterm elections. Both were in the Senate for Clinton\\'s trial in January and February of 1999. Frequent Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a congressman from South Carolina, was also one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment. \\n')\n",

They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. \\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" He claimed that the \"many people\" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.\\nThen he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\\nBreaking down Trump\\'s comments\\nHere is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \\n\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn\\'t they have a problem with it? Because they didn\\'t have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\\nGot that?\\nLet\\'s break it down claim by claim.\\n1) The many people who listened to the call didn\\'t have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn\\'t have a problem. Nobody.\\n2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\\n3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\\n4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\\nIn summary: Trump went from\\nA) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to\\nB) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\\nC) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \\nD) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\\nHe can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let\\'s dig in:\\nA fact check\\nAs Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House\\'s National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\\'s support of Ukraine.\" \\nThe Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration\\'s attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call\\'s aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\\nThe whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \\nThe White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \\nTrump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We\\'ll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\\nIt was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\\n')\n"

The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky toÂ\\xa0investigateÂ\\xa0former Vice President Joe Biden and hisÂ\\xa0son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\\nA transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\\nIn the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced â??evidence,â?\\x9d such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaneyâ??s role in Trumpâ??s conversations with Zelensky.\\nâ??â?¦Bolton told a National Security Council staffer â??to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaneyâ??

The White Houseâ??s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\\nâ??We do that all the time with foreign policy,â?\\x9d Mulvaney said. â??And I have news for everybody: Get over it.

       "      <td>(CNN)A former Georgia police officer was sentenced to 12 years in prison Friday for the killing of  a mentally ill, unarmed and naked black man in 2015.  \\nDeKalb County Superior Court Judge LaTisha Dear Jackson gave Robert \"Chip\" Olsen a 20-year term, with 12 years to be served in custody. Under the sentence, Olsen is prohibited from working in law enforcement, possessing firearms or profiting from the case. \\nDear Jackson praised what she said was the strength, fortitude and compassion of the family of the victim, 26-year-old Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. She said she had also watched the defendant closely during the trial. \\n\"Many might have thought you were stoic and void of emotion,\" the judge told Olsen. \"From the time opening statements started, I saw the tears that you've had. I saw how you replayed March 9, 2015, in your head.\" \\nProsecutors had asked the court for a 25-year sentence with five years probation. \\nA jury last month acquitted Olsen of murder in the March 2015 death of Hill but found him guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath.\\nJurors deliberated for more than a week. Olsen had faced up to 35 years in prison.\\nBefore sentencing, the court heard from Hill's mother, father and sister.\\n\"The decision Robert Olsen made that day changed my life forever,\" said his mother, Carolyn Baylor Giummo. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\\nShe remembered her son as a compassionate child, a talented choir singer and student-athlete whose life seemed to change after his deployment to Afghanistan.   \\n\"He didn't come back unscathed,\" she said. At the time of the shooting, Hill had had stopped taking his medications because of side effects and suffered a breakdown, she said. \\nGiummo recalled her father always telling her and his grandchildren that \"if you're ever in trouble, run to the police.\"\\n\"The jury may have found Mr. Robert Olsen not guilty of murder but he still killed my son,\" she told the court. \"He has never taken responsibility for taking my son's life. He's never just said, 'I'm sorry for killing Tony.'\"\\n Anthony Hill, Sr., said he felt as if he had failed as a father for not protecting his son. He lamented that the defendant never once looked him in the eye with an expression of remorse. \\n\"I stood out in that passageway many a day just hoping to make a little bit of eye contact,\" he said. \"Not one time would he look my way.\"\\nOlsen's wife, Catherine, read a statement in court. She said one of the few times she saw her husband break down emotionally was after he killed Hill. \\n\"He was mourning for the individual whose life he had taken,\" she said, adding that she and Olsen recognize the pain of Hill's family. \\n\"I cannot imagine how hard this had been for his parents and family,\" she said.  \\nCatherine Olsen was overcome by emotion as her husband was taken away by officers after the sentencing.\\nOlsen did not address the court.\\nBefore the shooting, someone in Hill's neighborhood called police to report a man was \"acting deranged, knocking on doors, and crawling around on the ground naked,\" then-DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said then.\\nOlsen was dispatched, and \"when (Hill) saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer. The officer called him to stop while stepping backwards, drew his weapon and fired two shots,\" Alexander said.\\nDefense attorney Amanda Clark Palmer said Olsen, who worked for the DeKalb County police, was \"a good cop who had to make a tough decision.\"\\nHill's girlfriend previously said he had a history of mental illness and struggled to get the support he needed from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had stopped taking his medication shortly before his death, she said. \\nDuring closing arguments, the prosecution claimed Olsen did not follow protocol for using force. Assistant District Attorney Lance Cross said Olsen could have used a baton on Hill.\\n</td>\n",

If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nThe election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \\nCritics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\\nThe provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\\nWhile Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)Mary Kerrie Davis had smoked cigarettes for most of her adult life, when she embraced vaping as a way to quit.\\nFor several years, the 52-year-old mother from Georgia vaped only nicotine. But after trying THC cartridges, she began to experience health problems. On September 6, she died.\\nMary Kerrie's case sounds like the nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related injury confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of this week, the outbreak has led to 37 vaping-related deaths in 24 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands.\\nMany of those cases and deaths were among people who vaped THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.\\n\"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters in October. \"But I'd like to stress that we don't know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or way that the devices are producing harm.\"\\nMary Kerrie's death hasn't yet been counted in the CDC's total. Her grieving family has many questions still without answers. But they believe that vaping THC is what ultimately led to her death.\\nFrom smoking to vaping\\nWhen Mary Kerrie transitioned to vaping nicotine a few years ago, she stopped smoking cigarettes completely, her daughter, Maggie Davis, said. Mary Kerrie was adamant with family and friends that vaping was healthier than smoking.\\n\"She thought it was safer,\" her husband, Kevin Davis, said. \"I certainly liked the fact that there wasn't the cigarette smell and her breath didn't smell like cigarettes. I kind of thought it was better, too.\"\\nMaggie remembers that her mom came to California this summer to help her move into her dorm for her senior year of college. While there, Mary Kerrie went to a vape shop and purchased THC cartridges for the first time.\\nImmediately upon returning home, she developed a nagging cough. Kevin didn't know Mary Kerrie had been vaping THC cartridges. Only after her death did the Davis family learn that Mary Kerrie had continued buying and using THC cartridges in Georgia. Unlike in California, THC is illegal in the Davis' home state.\\n'I hope you don't have that vaping disease'\\nMary Kerrie experienced a steady decline in health between the time she started vaping THC cartridges and her death. The initial health effects she had experienced from vaping to quit smoking transitioned into frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a terrible cough. They're all among the reported symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\nMary Kerrie went to the hospital for assessment on September 4. A flu swab tested negative. She texted her daughter that she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nMaggie had just begun hearing reports of a national outbreak of a mystery illness related to vaping. She texted her mom, \"I hope you don't have that vaping disease.\"\\nOn the way home from the hospital, groaning between coughs, Mary Kerrie said, \"I'm never smoking again. I'm throwing out all of my e-cigarettes and weed pens,\" Maggie wrote in a personal essay for her college newspaper.\\nKevin, an OB/GYN, encouraged Mary Kerrie when she declared she was quitting it all.\\nStill, Mary Kerrie's symptoms became worse over the next two days. She stayed home from social gatherings, telling her husband that she just needed rest.\\nHe felt she should be seen again by a doctor.\\nDays later, on September 6, Mary Kerrie was still sick. It was Kevin who found her, lips blue and gasping for breath, whispering, \"help.\"\\nOn the way to the hospital again, Mary Kerrie's pulse was barely detectable. She'd become unresponsive.\\nAt the hospital, doctors performed CPR unsuccessfully.\\nMoments later, Mary Kerrie -- an outgoing 52-year-old who loved rollerskating and mountain biking, a mother and wife who was known for being vivacious and happy -- was gone.\\n\"She will never see her youngest daughter graduate high school, nor her oldest graduate college,\" Maggie wrote after her death. \"She will never see her daughters married or meet her grandchildren. Her absence, a sudden and jarring hole in my family, will be felt for decades to come.\"\\nIn X-rays on the day Mary Kerrie presented at the hospital, her lungs had looked clear. Two days later, they revealed a white substance resembling clouds infiltrating Mary Kerrie's lungs.\\n'From healthy to drowning in your own lungs'\\nTo the Davis family, the X-rays seemed to confirm what they had heard in the news: Mary Kerrie's illness wasn't simply a case of pneumonia. In addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain, the whiteout in her lungs was one of the symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\n\"This wasn't a nursing home patient. This wasn't somebody with a chronic illness,\" Kevin said. \"You don't just go from healthy to drowning in your own lungs and a flatline EKG from things in your daily life.\"\\nNearly two months after Mary Kerrie's death, her case is still not part of the official CDC count of vaping-related lung injury deaths.\\nIn part, it speaks to just how new of a phenomenon this is. The ongoing investigation \"may take a few months\" and could yield \"multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\" CDC's Schuchat told reporters early in October.\\nFor the Davis family, the wait has been frustrating. To them, it seems obvious that Mary Kerrie's death is related to vaping.\\nKevin said he recently spoke with a CDC official who said that his wife's case met the agency's definition of a vaping-related illness, but the agency is waiting for the county medical examiner's decision before making an announcement.\\nThere have already been three confirmed vaping-related deaths in Georgia. If and when it is announced, Mary Kerrie's death could be the fourth, potentially making Georgia's death count the highest in the United States.\\nMary Kerrie's legacy\\nThe Davis family and Mary Kerrie's friends want her to be remembered for the good she brought into their lives.\\n\"She was all in on me and all in on our daughters, all in on her family. Anything that she wanted to be a part of, it was everything for her,\" Kevin said of their 24-year marriage. \"Her energy is beautiful, and I sure miss her.\"\\nThe Davis family attributes part of the blame for Mary Kerrie's death to a lack of regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration.\\n\"Marijuana pens also boast exponentially higher numbers of THC, and yet we still do not know how this historically disproportionate consumption of marijuana affects the human body, particularly when consumed as an oil,\" Maggie wrote.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA warned consumers to stop using THC vaping products as investigations into vaping-related lung injuries and deaths continue. Last week, the CDC made a similar warning, saying \"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC.\"\\n\"Mary Kerrie vaped [nicotine] products for several years I would say, successfully, and did quit smoking,\" Kevin said. \"I think when she was exposed to legal THC in California and then got illicit THC in Georgia ... I think that's what killed her.\"\\n\"Other people, if they're being exposed to something that can kill them, I hope they stop,\" Kevin said. \"I hope her passing helps somebody else.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York  (CNN Business)Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash pile keeps expanding, but Warren Buffett's industrial and insurance conglomerate has yet to make a major acquisition to ramp up growth.\\nBerkshire on Saturday reported it has $128 billion in cash, up from $122 billion in the second quarter.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has lagged the market this year, and Buffett has said that he wants to make an \"elephant\" sized acquisition with the company's mountain of cash. The problem is that the market rally has made any potential targets much more expensive, and Buffett has said he doesn't want to overspend on deals.\\nBerkshire's operating profit rose to $7.9 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year earlier, boosted by gains across its holdings. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's performance is tied to its many subsidiaries -- which include GEICO, railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe and consumer brands like Duracell, Dairy Queen and paint maker Benjamin Moore -- as well as a massive investment portfolio.\\nBerkshire also said tariffs from the US-China trade war weighed on its consumer and industrial businesses. The tariffs cut into sales of Precision Castparts, it gas turbine and pipe products unit, the filings said. BNSF railroad saw a 5% profit gain due to cost-cutting measures to offset a drag from trade tensions.\\nWhile Berkshire has yet to make a major acquisition, the company has been taking steps to embrace more reasonably valued tech stocks in recent years. Berkshire Hathaway still owns large stakes in value stalwarts like Coke, (KO) Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX) and Kraft Heinz, (KHC) which has taken billions of dollars in writedowns this year on some of its top brands.\\nBut the company's biggest holding now is Apple (AAPL), and Berkshire even has a small stake in Amazon (AMZN).\\nBerkshire Hathaway also purchased $700 million of its own stock in the third quarter, an uptick from the $442 million it bought last quarter. The company purchased $1.7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter.\\nPreviously, the company did not allow stock buybacks. The board changed a rule last year to allow the company to begin purchasing back billions of dollars worth of stock, a practice that has been criticized by some analysts as inflating share prices.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)McDonald's Happy Meal might be for kids, but officially it's over the hill. \\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of the company's first Happy Meal, the kids meal that helped McDonald's achieve fast food supremacy. Today, roughly one in every four orders at McDonald's includes a Happy Meal, according to retail data tracker Sense360. \\nEach Happy Meal contains the option of a hamburger or chicken nuggets, a side like french fries and a drink. And a toy, some of which have become collector's items. \\nMcDonald's is celebrating this milestone by re-releasing some of its most popular toys over the past four decades, including Ty Beanie Babies' Patti the Platypus and the Tamagotchi. Between November 7 through 11, McDonald's (MCD) will sell a \"Surprise Happy Meal\" in 90 countries that will include the throwback toys.\\nIt's the latest quick-service restaurant to tap into nostalgia to excite customers. Since fast-food customers are not particularly loyal to any brand,  fast-food companies must resort to marketing tactics or wacky food creations to draw in customers.\\nHere's a brief history of the Happy Meal:\\n1979\\nThe Circus Wagon Happy Meal, as it was originally known, launched in the United States in June 1979. The meal included a hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and cookies. Some of the early Happy Meal toys included a McDoodler stencil, McWrist wallet and a spinning top. The box became instantly recognizable with the meal. \\n1982\\nAfter becoming a hit in the United States, McDonald's expanded the meal internationally. It debuted first in Latin America before hitting Australia and New Zealand. \\n1984\\nMcDonald's added McNuggets as a Happy Meal option. The addition inspired a line of Happy Meal toys modeled after the McNuggets.\\n1991\\nMcDonald's partnered with United Airlines (UAL) to offer Happy Meals on some of its flights. The deal ended in 2001.\\n1998\\nThe first-ever global Happy Meal debuted with Disney film \"Mulan.\" The meal had identical packaging and toys across 40 countries.\\n2012 - 2013\\nAs its customers shifted toward healthier eating habits, McDonald's began overhauling the Happy Meal. In 2012, McDonald's made the french fries portion smaller, and it added fruit as an option. In 2013, it added milk or juice as beverage choices.\\n2018\\nMcDonald's said it would provide cheeseburgers in Happy Meals only upon request. It removed artificial preservatives from some of its entrees and added bottled water as a drink option. The company said that 3.4 billion fruit, low-fat dairy and water items have been served in Happy Meals in the US since 2013.\\n2020\\nStarting next year, McDonald's will add a new reduced-sugar and low-fat chocolate milk option. It has 25% less sugar compared to the previous version.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)Toys \"R\" Us is returning to select malls in major metropolitan areas this holiday season with what it hopes is an innovative retail plan that could upend how stores sell toys.\\nIt comes two years after the company filed for bankruptcy and shuttered all its locations - seemingly for good - and just after toymaker Hasbro (HAS) reported disappointing third quarter sales heading into the industry's most crucial sales season. Hasbro's chief rival, Mattel (MAT), enjoyed a sales surge of 3% over the same period. Both toy companies' success was largely tied to Toys \"R\" Us prior to the retailer's financial demise and rebirth.\\nThe revamped Toys \"R\" Us will open two streamlined locations ahead of Black Friday in Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and The Galleria in Houston.\\n\"We know that customers love shopping as a means of entertainment. That's something built into the DNA of human beings,\" Richard Barry, president and CEO of Toys \"R\" Us parent company, Tru Kids, told CNN Business. \"We also know kids and families are looking for things to do on the weekends or when school's out. We know parents and families really value play and the value of toys overall. As we thought about the strategy, we wanted to put all those things together.\"\\nThese are not simply stores, according to the company. The store chain will partner with the retail service startup B8ta to create hands-on, engaging experiences for kids and their parents, who may have fond memories of Toys \"R\" Us from their own childhoods.\\nThe old Toys \"R\" Us stores were 40,000-square-foot behemoths with merchandise stacked on endless rows of metal shelves. The new stores are about 6,500 square feet, with interactive spaces where kids and parents can play with toys.\\nThe revalitized Toys \"R\" Us website also showcases fewer toys, but gives more details on them. Those looking to purchase items are redirected to Target's (TGT) website, which provides inventory and fulfillment services.\\nB8ta, which designs interactive stores displays where shoppers can try the latest products, will bring theaters, video games, and other engaging items to the new Toys \"R\" Us stores.\\n\"We've got a huge treehouse in the middle of the store that kids will be able to climb into, an event space for movies in the store. We'll have great brands in the store,\" Barry said.\\nJohn Goodman, CEO of Candytopia, helped implement this \"shop-o-tainment\" idea two years ago before partnering with Toys \"R\" Us earlier this year to launch \"Toys R Us Adventure,\" a touring indoor play space appearing in select malls across the country for a limited time. The ticketed attraction costs $20 for children ages 4-12 and $28 for adults. It features toy-themed play areas for small children who, the company hopes, will bug their parents to buy them merchandise associated with the fun zones they've just finished exploring. \\nThese pop-up playlands aren't permanent stores. After about six months they will set up shop somewhere else.\\nGoodman, who previously served as CEO of The Gap (GPS), Kmart, and Sears, used a similar blueprint to help Candytopia founder Jackie Sorkin turn her birthday party and event business into a multi-million dollar, confection-themed touring attraction celebrated by celebrity influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore.\\nToys \"R\" Adventure's first run in Chicago and Atlanta generated national headlines last week as families celebrated the return of the familiar retail brand.  Pictures and videos of smiling, laughing children walking through imitation snow caves and interacting with the Toys \"R\" Us mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, are circulating now on Instagram and Facebook.\\nThe Toys \"R\" Us Adventure in Atlanta's Lenox Marketplace shopping complex was nearly filled to capacity, Goodman said. \\n\"We feel like we're adding a service to the mall in terms of driving additional traffic, anything from 1,700 to 2,200 people every single day,\" Goodman told CNN Business. \"It's like the circus. The circus comes to town and the circus leaves. It may or may not be back in a couple of years. That's how our model is built.\"\\nThis idea isn't exactly new, but it is catching on elsewhere. The minds behind New Jersey's new American Dream mall, which opened on Friday, came up with a similar concept. The Rutherford, New Jersey shopping complex is less a place to buy consumer goods and more of an indoor theme park with cartoon-themed attractions in its Nickelodeon Universe. It also has an indoor ski slope, a water park, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink.\\nScott Webb, CEO of the digital consulting firm Avionos, says this may be the future of toy-related, brick-and-mortar retail shopping. Encouraging kids to play with toys that aren't tied to TV, movie, or video game characters is crucial for the industry, which has struggled in an era when children binge watching shows on streaming services often avoid commercials advertising toys that they won't see on their favorite shows.\\n\"Kids as much as anything are digital consumers now,\" Webb told CNN Business. \"The Hasbro numbers back this up. The segments of toys that have really thrived are those tied to some intellectual property, whether it's Fortnite or Marvel or Star Wars.\" \\nWebb said Toys \"R\" Us turning its company into a toy discovery brand as opposed to a retailer may be a good strategy. \"I think they absolutely have a lot of brand equity to carve out a new niche in that role,\" he continued. \"But I think it would be hard to predict them ever discovering the same dominance in retail.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Busines)America's top supermarkets are facing a new challenge: Grocery aisles in stores aren't suited to meet the growing demand for online orders.\\nSo Walmart, Albertsons, Stop &amp; Shop, Meijer, Hy-Vee and others are building automated mini-warehouses inside their stores and opening up \"dark stores\" — locations that look like supermarkets but are closed to customers — to make deliveries and prepare pickup orders.\\nAlthough only around 5% of US shoppers buy their groceries online today, analysts expect that number to rise in the coming years.\\nWalmart has trained more than 30,000 workers to fulfill customers' online grocery orders, but in some cases that has led to congested aisles with workers in its own stores during peak shopping times, such as weekends.\\nWalmart US chief Greg Foran earlier this year said an executive complained to him, \"'I hate shopping in the store on Sunday trying to get up and down the aisles.'\"\\nFor grocers that partner with third-party services, often \"there are as many people selecting for Instacart as there are customers,\" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail and grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.\\nGrocery store margins are tight. And workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is expensive for grocers. That's why grocers are looking to technology to reduce costs and keep aisles from jamming up.\\n'Micro-fulfillment centers' \\nAlbertsons and Stop &amp; Shop are testing automated \"micro-fulfillment centers\" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.\\nStop &amp; Shop, owned by Dutch parent Ahold Delhaize, is building a 12,000-square-foot fully automated fulfillment center in the backroom of a store in Windsor, Connecticut, for deliveries in the Hartford area. Stop &amp; Shop offers delivery through its online Peapod service.\\nMeijer announced this month that it will also begin testing micro-fulfillment with a logistics company to \"maximize space in our stores\" and expand online options, said Sid Handa, the company's director of strategic supply chain initiatives.\\nAnd in Salem, New Hampshire, Walmart is piloting a system with autonomous carts that gather customers' grocery orders and bring them to Walmart workers, who then prepare them for delivery or pickup.\\nSome analysts say these models are an advantage over large, centralized warehouses, which are often located further away from customers than stores. That's why micro-fulfillment centers can save grocers in delivery costs, according to experts.\\n\"Micro-fulfillment helps retailers solve the labor and last-mile costs conundrum,\" Christopher Mandeville, analyst at Jefferies, said in a research report earlier this month. \\nMandeville estimates that the cost of delivering groceries from central warehouses is usually around two times higher than using micro-fulfillment in stores. Jefferies cut Kroger's stock earlier this month in part because the company has invested in centralized facilities through a deal with Ocado, instead of micro-fulfillment.\\nGrocers are also moving the picking process out of stores entirely and testing so-called dark stores. Some dark stores have automation, while others are still manned by employees to do all of the picking of goods purchased online, said Mandeville.\\n\"Dark stores in grocery are an emerging trend,\" said Michael Demko, founder of grocery consulting firm Locai Solutions.\\nWalmart recently opened Walmart Pickup Point, a 40,000-square-foot prototype outside of Chicago at a former Dominick's grocery store. Customers drive up to the site to designated parking spots, and a Walmart worker loads up their trunk with their order. Walmart can also make deliveries from the location. \\nThe inside of the location looks like a Walmart with groceries and everyday items. Unlike a traditional Walmart supercenter, however, customers won't be able go inside.\\nStop &amp; Shop has an approximately 40,000-square-foot dark store in Whitman, Massachusetts, on the site of a former grocery store tailored to make deliveries.\\nAnd Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, is testing four dark stores. The inside looks similar to a store but without signs, according to a spokesperson for the company.\\nThe locations are designed to fill shoppers' online orders while allowing traditional stores to \"continue to serve the needs of those who enjoy the in-store experience,\" the Hy-Vee spokesperson said.\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of Stop &amp; Shop's 'dark store' in Massachusetts.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)The chilling story of Jayme Closs, the 13-year-old Wisconsin girl who was kidnapped after her parents were killed last year, was national news.\\nBut people might be less familiar with the story of Arianna Fitts, a 2-year-old who went missing in 2016 before her mother was found brutally murdered in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\nEach of these cases is compelling, but the two didn't receive the same amount of media attention. Some experts believe it's because Closs is white and Fitts is black.\\nIn fact, data shows that missing white children receive far more media coverage than missing black and brown children, despite higher rates of missing children among communities of color.\\nThe FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database lists 424,066 missing children under 18 in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. About 37 percent of those children are black, even though black children only make up about 14 percent of all children in the United States.\\nIt's harder to say how many Hispanic kids are missing. The FBI's report groups white and Hispanic children together. Based on other reports, about 20 percent of missing children are Hispanic or Latino, according to Robert Lowery, vice president of the missing child division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). But the real number, he said, is likely higher.\\n\"I think there's a false belief that white children make up the biggest number of missing children when in fact (proportionally) it's just the opposite,\" Lowery said, adding that the high number of black girls reported missing is particularly concerning.\\nHere are some reasons experts say we don't hear more about missing children of color:\\nTheir families are hesitant to call police\\nSome families are hesitant to contact law enforcement, even if they think their child is missing.\\n\"There's a sense of distrust between law enforcement and the minority community,\" said Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation.\\nThat distrust contributes to a \"silent code of 'no snitching,'\" Wilson said, adding that it is important for people who suspect a child is missing to speak up.\\n\"It could be your child, your mother, your father that's missing,\" she said. \"You would want someone to speak up to help find them.\"\\nOther families might not report that their child is missing because they fear it could have unintended, negative consequences. \\nFor example, Lowery suspects missing Latino children are underreported because some families with undocumented members might not contact police for fear of being deported. \\nThey don't get as much media coverage\\nNews media organizations have often been criticized for not giving missing black children the amount of attention they give missing white kids. \\nA 2010 study found that black children were significantly underrepresented in TV news. Even though about a third of all missing children in the FBI's database were black, they only made up about 20 percent of the missing children cases covered in the news. \\nA 2015 study was bleaker: though black children accounted for about 35% of missing children cases in the FBI's database, they amounted to only 7% of media references.\\nExperts say media coverage is vital to helping solve those cases.\\n\"It puts law enforcement on alert, and they add additional resources to the case,\" Wilson said. \"If no one knows about it, then no one's doing anything to find them or to help them get the assistance they need.\"\\nFamilies don't have the resources\\nFamilies don't always have the financial resources to respond appropriately when their child is missing. They might not be able to afford a private investigator or take off from work to help look for their child and follow up with law enforcement and the media. \\nAnd in some cases, they may not know what to do.\\nWilson said some people are under the misconception that they must wait 48 hours before filing a police report, when that waiting period varies by location. Places like Illinois or Washington, DC, don't have waiting periods to report a child missing.\\nKnowing the laws in your state helps. And when in doubt, contact law enforcement immediately. \\nThere are other resources that families can utilize as well.\\nThe Black and Missing Foundation helps families of color file police reports, create missing posters and spread the word about missing children.\\nFacebook groups offer an online community for parents to alert the public about their missing child and ask questions of others who have had similar experiences. \\nEliseo Montoya, who runs the Facebook group Runaway and Missing Children in California, said he keeps the page going because it allows families to feel like they're doing something even when it seems like authorities are giving up. \\n\"A page like mine is very important for people of color because nobody really embraces people of color,\" Montoya said.\\nSome get classified as runaways\\nWhen most people think of missing children, they think of young children abducted by strangers. But missing children can refer to kids who are abducted by relatives or children who leave home, either voluntarily or after being lured by someone else.\\nMany missing children of color are classified as runaways, Wilson said. And while running away from home isn't a problem unique to nonwhite children, they are particularly vulnerable. \\nA significant number of nonwhite children who go missing are either homeless or in foster care, said Wilson, and many are at risk for sex trafficking. Data shows black children are overrepresented in foster care and are at a much higher risk for homelessness. \\nLaw enforcement often classify children of color as runaways without having all the details, Wilson said. Because those kids are considered to have voluntarily left home, Amber alerts aren't sent out about them and they typically aren't covered in the news. \\nRunaway cases and abductions by family members don't get the same attention that abductions by non-family members or strangers do. But all these scenarios fall under the \"missing\" umbrella. A child is missing if they are under the age of 18 and their legal guardian doesn't know where they are.\\nThe NCMEC no longer distinguishes between runaways and abductions on their posters of missing children.\\n\"Frankly, we were dealing with a desensitized public and media when we did that,\" Lowery said. \"Now if you check our website, our children are just listed as missing child.\"\\nWilson stressed that runaway cases should be treated with the same urgency.\\n\"We have to be mindful,\" she said. \"What did they leave from, and what are they ultimately running to?\"\\nSometimes, children of color get classified as runaways when they are truly missing. Wilson said her organization has seen many such cases. \\n\"We tell parents all the time, you know your child better than anyone else, their behavior, their characteristics,\" she said. \"If you believe your child did not run away, you just have to stand firm with law enforcement and let them know that this is uncharacteristic of your child.\" \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)C-H-A-O-S.\\nThat's been the watchword of Donald Trump's presidency -- a roiling, sprawling circus of content and controversy that never slows down and never rests. Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?\\nThe answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\\nConsider what we've seen just since Friday:\\n1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card\\n2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\\n3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \\n4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\\n5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\\n6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \\n7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails\\nAnd in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\\nThe rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.\\nAt one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\\nAnd the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\\nFrom a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \\nBut by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\\nEven for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.\\nNow consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\\nThe real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)A senior adviser to Vice President Mike Pence is likely to comply with a request to testify on Thursday in front of the committees leading the impeachment inquiry, multiple sources say.\\nJennifer Williams would be the first person on Pence's national security team to appear and has knowledge of how much the vice president knew about the efforts by President Donald Trump and those around him to push Ukraine to launch investigations into Joe Biden and his son, as well as 2016 election interference, according to a source familiar with her thinking. \\nWilliams, along with other senior administration and national security officials, was listening to the phone call on July 25 in which Trump asked for a \"favor\" of his newly-elected Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, a White House source says. Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\\nWilliams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\\nPence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\\nLawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.\\nOver a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\\nSince then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\\nThe three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nCurrent and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\\nThe official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces. Until Williams joined Pence's staff, she was a spokesperson for several years at the US embassy in London, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also held posts at the embassies in Beirut, Lebanon and Kingston, Jamaica.\\n\"Jen is the type of person who I know to be dedicated to the institution above anything else,\" said Brett Bruen, the former Director of Global Engagement at the White House under President Barack Obama.\\nShe comes from the cadre of diplomats \"who are not going to be easily intimidated or hold back information,\" Bruen added. \"She is someone who is pretty tough and has had tough assignments that have steeled her to the kind of pressure and the intimidation tactics that have been used against others.\"\\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more precisely reflect Williams' role.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)It used to be said that \"all politics is local.\" That's not really the case anymore. \\nVoters may be casting ballots for politicians to state government, but their feelings about President Donald Trump will be paramount. That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \\nKentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \\nYet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \\nIf Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \\nThe same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \\nThe polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \\nYou can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \\nHood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \\nAfter the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \\nIf there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \\nThose slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \\nWere Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\\nI would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \\nStill, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)The outcome of races in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia on Tuesday could shed light on how the country is leaning in the middle of an impeachment inquiry and as it heads into a presidential election year. \\nAs the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump deepens in Washington, voters will head to the polls a year after Democrats took the US House, testing the political landscape. \\nVoters will decide the next governors of Kentucky and Mississippi, two solidly red states that voted for Trump in 2016. The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. \\nAll eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates.\\nHere's a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: \\nKentucky governor \\nRepublican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state's attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   \\nTrump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor's office in the state. \\nTrump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin's victory came within 10 points of his opponent.\\nMedicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.\\nIn 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\\nBeshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \\nPolls close at 6 p.m. local time. \\nMississippi governor\\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  \\nTrump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \\nCook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\\nHood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \\nThere is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nVice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. \\nVirginia legislature \\nRepublicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\\nDemocrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\\nDemocrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.\\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.\\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)There are plenty of people arguing that President Donald Trump is breaking the law by encouraging news organizations to out the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine triggered the impeachment investigation.\\nHere's the problem with that view: The President is the law when it comes to protecting national security whistleblowers. And now it's the President who is leading the attack. \\n\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \\nHe's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\\nBut the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \\nThere are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\\nWhen that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\\nKohn added: \"If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\\nAnd Trump has made clear where he stands. \\nHe wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\\n\"It's a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\\nBut certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\\nThe whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\\nHarassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\\n\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\\nDevine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\\nHe ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\\nBut that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\\nAnd then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\\nBut no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \\n\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\\nToobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\\n\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\\nBut that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\\nUltimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)News footage from an October 20, 2018, midterm election rally in Nevada shows indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas standing behind President Donald Trump.\\nParnas and his business partner and fellow Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, are alleged by prosecutors to have illegally funded donations from foreign nations to Republican political campaigns in attempts to buy influence. They are also alleged to have aided Giuliani, the President's personal attorney, in efforts to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe video of the rally is the latest example of how the pair who had little record of donations to candidates before 2018, wielded their proximity to Giuliani and used political donations to gain access to the president and political campaigns. Photos and videos throughout 2018 and 2019 show the pair traveling with the former New York City mayor throughout the world and to political events across the country.\\nThe footage was found by CNN's KFile during a review of the travel and political activity of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman.\\nParnas and Fruman were arrested in October attempting to leave the country. They were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week to the charges. Parnas and Fruman were ordered to house confinement and subject to GPS monitoring after they each secured a $1 million bond. \\nIn the videos, Parnas sits in the area directly behind Trump before and during the rally.  Parnas, who at times is wearing a blue hat and glasses, can be seen apparently taking a video of the President on his cellphone as he walks up the stairs to the stage.\\nAt another point, Parnas leaves the area behind the podium to be along the path of the Trump's exit at the bottom of the stage. He waves to the president as he leaves, and the president waves back in the direction of Parnas and the crowd.\\nIt is unclear how Parnas, who is not a Nevada native, got into the prized seating area directly behind the President. A photo from Parnas' Instagram featured in a video by the Wall Street Journal shows he appeared to have a VIP badge for the event.\\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman since their indictment.\\n\"I don't know those gentlemen,\" the President said earlier this month. \"Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here.\"\\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump added. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do but I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy, I just don't know.\"\\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman returned a request for comment. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. A lawyer for Fruman did not return a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. \\nRally mentioned in indictments\\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York described the October 2018 rally in the 21-page indictment of Parnas, Fruman and their associates David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were both indicted on a conspiracy charge. Correia and Kukushkin have also pleaded not guilty.\\nThe prosecutors wrote that \"on or about October 20, 2018,\" Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for \"Candidate-1\" in Nevada and took photos with \"Candidate-2.\" The trio then sent the photographs to \"Foreign National-1,\" whose identity has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe candidates were later identified as Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wesley Duncan. Trump appeared at the rally to campaign for Laxalt. A photo from Parnas' now-private Instagram, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal, shows him and Fruman posing for a photograph with Laxalt previously during a September 2018 fundraiser. A spokesperson for Laxalt told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he \"doesn't know the man.\"\\nOne of several midterm events attended by Parnas and Fruman  \\nThe Trump rally in Nevada was one of many events attended by Fruman and Parnas in the final weeks heading up the November 2018 midterm elections.\\nIn photos posted on Twitter, Parnas and Fruman can be seen accompanying Giuliani to events in Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Indiana and again in Nevada.\\nA November 3, 2018, tweet of a several photos from Michigan Senate candidate John James shows James sitting at a table with Giuliani and Parnas. In another photo, James can be seen speaking while Fruman sits in the first row of seats and Parnas stand with Giuliani off to the side. \\nPictures tweeted that same day from Giuliani and congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian show Giuliani with Parnas and Fruman while campaigning in Nevada. A video from that morning also shows Fruman and Parnas with Giuliani as he campaigns in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun.\\nAnother campaign event for then-Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on November 4, 2018, shows Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman among attendees according to photos shared from DeSantis's Twitter account.\\nParnas was also seen with Giuliani at campaign events for New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Eddie Edwards. Photos posted on Twitter show Edwards and Giuliani addressing supporters at several campaign events on November 5, 2018 -- the day before the midterm election -- with Parnas standing near Giuliani.\\n</td>\n",

Elizabeth Warren has the support of 22%, with a tight cluster of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (19%), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and Former Vice President Joe Biden (17%) all within striking distance of Warren.\\nThe results in the early voting state do not bode well for Biden and are similar to a September CNN/Des Moines Regiser/Mediacom poll in which Warren challenged Biden's dominance in the race. \\nThis also marks a jump for Buttigieg, who previously lagged behind the three longstanding frontrunners and clocked in at 9% in CNN's poll in Iowa last month.\\nBehind them, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar lands at 4%, and California Sen. Kamala Harris and businessman Andrew Yang at 3% each in Friday's poll. The poll is Klobuchar's second poll that meets the standard to qualify for the December Democratic presidential debate, which requires 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC's criteria or 6% in two early state polls between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12.\\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Tom Steyer all garnered 2% of support.\\nTwo-thirds of likely caucusgoers in the poll said they could still change their minds about whom to support.\\nThe Times/Siena survey was conducted from Oct. 25-30, questioned 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\\n</td>\n",

The campaign push, in the final week of this month, included offers to triple and even quintuple all donations.  \\nThe Trump campaign has been positioning itself this fall to be ready to capitalize on Trump's perceived accomplishments and political battles. \\nDuring the final game of the World Series earlier this week, the campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy, airing a video nationally which checked off the President's accomplishments and went after his Washington rivals. It focuses on Trump's efforts to combat ISIS and boost the economy, and it also highlights his battles with Democrats and the Russia investigation.\\nOn Friday, a day after the House vote, Facebook ads from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee asked supporters to \"add your name\" to the people willing to \"Stand with President Trump\" in the face of the impeachment inquiry.\\nSupporters then are encouraged to leave their names, email addresses, ZIP codes and mobile numbers.\\nIn a recent conference call with reporters, a Trump official called the reelection effort a \"digital first campaign\" that can swiftly seize on fast-moving news, such as developments in the impeachment inquiry, to target voters and test and tweak advertising messages on digital platforms.\\n\"They are running a highly sophisticated operation,\" Reid Vineis, vice president for digital at Republican ad-buying firm Majority Strategies, said of the Trump operation. \"The Trump campaign has been essentially building a database for the 2020 general election.\"\\nOf particular value: The campaign's collection of mobile phone numbers.\\n\"Politics is much more effective at a one-to-one level,\" Vineis said. \"Text messages are read almost 100% of the time. The Trump campaign's accumulation of all this text-messaging data gives them a direct line to voters.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hong Kong (CNN Business)A growing number of smaller companies are adopting a four-day workweek. Now the results of a recent trial at Microsoft (MSFT) suggest it could work even for the biggest businesses.\\nThe company introduced a program this summer in Japan called the \"Work Life Choice Challenge,\" which shut down its offices every Friday in August and gave all employees an extra day off each week.\\nThe results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year, the company said in a statement last week. \\nIn addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails. \\nThey suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft's, of course).\\nThe effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft's 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company. \\nBy shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity. \\nThe initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — culture of overwork. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: karoshi means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.\\nThe issue attracted international attention in 2015, when an employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu committed suicide on Christmas Day. Tokyo officials later said that the staffer had worked excessive amounts of overtime.\\nTwo years later, a reporter at a Japanese broadcaster died after working punishing long hours. Her employer said she had clocked in 159 hours of overtime the month before her death.\\nThat has led businesses to start searching for solutions. Some companies have begun offering employees more flexibility, and the government has launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday,\" which encourages workers to leave early every last Friday of the month.\\nMicrosoft, for its part, says it will conduct another experiment in Japan later this year. It plans to ask employees to come up with new measures to improve work-life balance and efficiency, and will also ask other companies to join the initiative.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)Starbucks aims to get bigger by going smaller, with a new store format that's a fraction the size of its normal cafe. \\nThe coffee chain is opening \"Starbucks Pick-Up,\" a first-of-its-kind location in the United States that encourages orders from its app. The store, located near New York City's Penn Station, opens Tuesday. Plans for the store were announced in September.\\nThe new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company's vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want \"convenience, comfort and connection\" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. \\nYoung said the store is meant to be \"predictable and effortless\" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. \\nThe store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe's 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. \\nThe design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.\\nCustomers aren't required to order from Starbucks' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. \\nThe digitally focused store is part of the company's goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. \\nStarbucks Pick-Up will help the company \"test and learn\" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.\\nThe new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That's a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. \\nStarbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It's similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. \\nCEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' earnings call this week that it's \"seeing encouraging early results\" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China's largest cities. \\nBoth Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company's portfolio of stores that are \"tuned to different needs at different times,\" Young said. \\nOn the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world's largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November. The four-story Chicago location is 43,000 square feet and is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location on the city's Magnificent Mile.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)I had a pair of new $249 AirPods Pro for less than 12 minutes when one tumbled out of my ear and landed an inch from the edge of a train platform. \\n\"I really thought you were going to go after it if it fell,\" the stranger next to me scoffed.\\nThe high-end earbuds are a lot of things: an audiophile's dream, a fashion statement, Snoopy's face in headphone form. But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple's starting model, you'll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple's original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product. \\nIn a sense, this is Apple (AAPL) doing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones. \\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes, mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple's rivals. It's a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it's become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple's product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\\n Apple hasn't shared how many AirPods it's sold, but the company's wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it's hard not to believe it. \\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned, with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it's tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it's like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ. \\nFor those moments when you don't want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people's voices without sacrificing what you're listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual's ear canal's shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud. \\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it's still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem. \\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car. \\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I'd argue he's right. AirPod loyalists are fanatical about the earbuds, and the love for them is about to get even deeper. \\nBuzz around the new Pro version will undoubtedly convince other Apple users to make a purchase, too. They'll also soon know the pain and anguish of (almost) losing a fallen earpiece.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)On Monday night at a campaign rally in Kentucky, home state Sen. Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \\nHere's what Paul said:\\n\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'\"\\nPaul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information &amp; dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\\nWhile that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\\nWhat Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\\nThat's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\\nHere's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\\nThe task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\\nTo date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\\nFixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\\nBut thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\\nWhat Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\\nIt's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\\nTo which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)All eyes are on Kentucky Tuesday, as Gov. Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\\nI asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\nCillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\\nBailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\\nBevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\\nGoforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.\\nAttorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\\nCillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\\nBailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\\nBut there are some clear differences between the two. \\nThe President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\\nBevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\\nCillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\\nBailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\\nAndy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\\nHe also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\\nCillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\\nBailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\\nBailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\\nThe President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\\nTrump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)Faced with a slew of national polls that show roughly half the country supports not only his impeachment but also his removal from office, President Donald Trump did what he always does: Just say stuff.\\n\"Well, you're reading the wrong polls. You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You're read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\\nThat response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\\nA bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\\nOn Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \\n\"If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!\".\\nAnd then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \\n\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\\nPresumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\\nWhich is fine! And smart!\\n(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\\nBut if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \\nThink of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\\nThat's not to say Trump's \"real\" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.\\nAnd honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\\nWhy haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\\nNo matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\\n</td>\n",

Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.\\nBut the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.\\nCastro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)The Justice Department said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are \"legally invalid\" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.\\nThe guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.\\nImpeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.\\nIn the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\\nThe five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.\\nOLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\\nThe administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\\nThe memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\\n</td>\n",

Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\\n\"I say to tonight to the media: do your job and print his name,\" Paul, a Kentucky Republican, yelled during a rally Trump held in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin ahead of Tuesday's gubernatorial election. The crowd of Trump supporters, many donning \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT\" shirts, erupted into applause and cheers, and some chanted \"Do your job!\" and pointed toward the area where members of the press gathered to cover the event.\\nPaul told the crowd \"we also now know the name of the whistleblower,\" but did not provide any personal knowledge of the person's identity, before going on to echo baseless claims of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \"The whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,\" Paul said. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\nSeveral other Republicans have called for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator's insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\\nDuring the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\nThe anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\\nOn Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \\nZaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.\\nIn September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.\\nTwo sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\\n'Deeply troubling and disappointing' \\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.\\n\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,\" King said. \\n\"It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \\nLater on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\\nRaskin argued that the \"attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic\" that is a \"distraction from the merits of the case.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)While senators await the House of Representatives to move into the public phase of their impeachment inquiry, aides and members are beginning to prepare for a likely Senate trial.\\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are cautious: there are no articles of impeachment and the House hasn't voted to impeach the President. But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \\nTalks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. \\nThat room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\\nAnd, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\\n\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\\nSenate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.\\nSchumer's office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House's impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.\\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\\nSchumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\\nA key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\\nThere is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections. Both were in the Senate for Clinton's trial in January and February of 1999. Frequent Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a congressman from South Carolina, was also one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's defenses of his actions often change over time. They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. \\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" He claimed that the \"many people\" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.\\nThen he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\\nBreaking down Trump's comments\\nHere is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \\n\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\\nGot that?\\nLet's break it down claim by claim.\\n1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.\\n2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\\n3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\\n4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\\nIn summary: Trump went from\\nA) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to\\nB) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\\nC) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \\nD) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\\nHe can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:\\nA fact check\\nAs Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" \\nThe Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call's aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\\nThe whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \\nThe White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \\nTrump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\\nIt was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\\n</td>\n",

Under the sentence, Olsen is prohibited from working in law enforcement, possessing firearms or profiting from the case. \\nDear Jackson praised what she said was the strength, fortitude and compassion of the family of the victim, 26-year-old Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. She said she had also watched the defendant closely during the trial. \\n\"Many might have thought you were stoic and void of emotion,\" the judge told Olsen. \"From the time opening statements started, I saw the tears that you've had. I saw how you replayed March 9, 2015, in your head.\" \\nProsecutors had asked the court for a 25-year sentence with five years probation. \\nA jury last month acquitted Olsen of murder in the March 2015 death of Hill but found him guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath.\\nJurors deliberated for more than a week. Olsen had faced up to 35 years in prison.\\nBefore sentencing, the court heard from Hill's mother, father and sister.\\n\"The decision Robert Olsen made that day changed my life forever,\" said his mother, Carolyn Baylor Giummo. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\\nShe remembered her son as a compassionate child, a talented choir singer and student-athlete whose life seemed to change after his deployment to Afghanistan.   \\n\"He didn't come back unscathed,\" she said. At the time of the shooting, Hill had had stopped taking his medications because of side effects and suffered a breakdown, she said. \\nGiummo recalled her father always telling her and his grandchildren that \"if you're ever in trouble, run to the police.\"\\n\"The jury may have found Mr. Robert Olsen not guilty of murder but he still killed my son,\" she told the court. \"He has never taken responsibility for taking my son's life. He's never just said, 'I'm sorry for killing Tony.'\"\\n Anthony Hill, Sr., said he felt as if he had failed as a father for not protecting his son. He lamented that the defendant never once looked him in the eye with an expression of remorse. \\n\"I stood out in that passageway many a day just hoping to make a little bit of eye contact,\" he said. \"Not one time would he look my way.\"\\nOlsen's wife, Catherine, read a statement in court. She said one of the few times she saw her husband break down emotionally was after he killed Hill. \\n\"He was mourning for the individual whose life he had taken,\" she said, adding that she and Olsen recognize the pain of Hill's family. \\n\"I cannot imagine how hard this had been for his parents and family,\" she said.  \\nCatherine Olsen was overcome by emotion as her husband was taken away by officers after the sentencing.\\nOlsen did not address the court.\\nBefore the shooting, someone in Hill's neighborhood called police to report a man was \"acting deranged, knocking on doors, and crawling around on the ground naked,\" then-DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said then.\\nOlsen was dispatched, and \"when (Hill) saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer. The officer called him to stop while stepping backwards, drew his weapon and fired two shots,\" Alexander said.\\nDefense attorney Amanda Clark Palmer said Olsen, who worked for the DeKalb County police, was \"a good cop who had to make a tough decision.\"\\nHill's girlfriend previously said he had a history of mental illness and struggled to get the support he needed from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had stopped taking his medication shortly before his death, she said. \\nDuring closing arguments, the prosecution claimed Olsen did not follow protocol for using force. Assistant District Attorney Lance Cross said Olsen could have used a baton on Hill.\\n  \n",

hundreds of thousands of people remain without power after storms swept through much of the eastern US on Halloween. \\nRetired priest John Thomas Connery, 82, was on his way to a church in Newport, New York, on Thursday night, when he was swept away by floodwater, according to a deacon who worked with Connery at various churches in the area.\\nConnery disobeyed a traffic control signal and drove into a flooded area in Norway, New York, said Michael Kopy, the state's director of emergency management. Connery got out of his car after it got stuck when the shoulder of the road collapsed, Kopy said. He lost his footing and was swept away, New York State Police said in a release.\\nConnery, who had served for 56 years and lived about 60 miles away in Glenville, planned to spend the night in the rectory and lead the All Saints Day mass in Newport on Friday morning, Deacon Jim Bower of the Holy Family Parish in Hicksville, told CNN. \\n\"It's always a tragedy when anyone passes away and I think we always take it harder when its someone that we know and have a great deal of respect and love for,\" Bower said.\\nBishop Edward B. Scharfenberger of the Diocese of Albany said Father Connery \"died as he lived -- serving the people of God without fear or concern for himself.\"\\nGeorge Walker, 79, died after high winds caused a tree to fall on his car Thursday in Knoxville, Tennessee, said Knoxville Police communications manager Scott Erland.\\n Walker was taken to a local medical center and later died of his injuries, police said.\\n\"It was a horrible situation,\" Erland said.\\nNearly 600,000 customers remained without power Friday from Virginia to Maine after storms swept through Thursday evening. Most of the outages were reported in New York and Maine.\\nCon Edison workers were working to restore service in Queens, New York, near John F. Kennedy International Airport, CNN affiliate WABC reported.\\nWinds blew trees down, and roofing materials and debris were stuck in power lines, the station reported.\\nTens of thousands of customers were also without power in Pennsylvania, Vermont, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\\nMore than 20 low-temperature records were set Thursday from the Midwest to the East Coast, CNN meteorologists said.\\n  \n",

                                            Washington (CNN)The winner of Mississippi's gubernatorial election Tuesday will not only have to capture the state's popular vote, but will also have to prevail in the state's unique election process for electing a governor and other statewide officials that was established during the Jim Crow era. \\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state's popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as \"leans Republican\" -- the state's unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. \\nA candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nThe election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \\nCritics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\\nThe provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\\nWhile Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\\n  \n",
       "4    (CNN)Mary Kerrie Davis had smoked cigarettes for most of her adult life, when she embraced vaping as a way to quit.\\nFor several years, the 52-year-old mother from Georgia vaped only nicotine. But after trying THC cartridges, she began to experience health problems. On September 6, she died.\\nMary Kerrie's case sounds like the nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related injury confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of this week, the outbreak has led to 37 vaping-related deaths in 24 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands.\\nMany of those cases and deaths were among people who vaped THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.\\n\"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters in October. \"But I'd like to stress that we don't know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or way that the devices are producing harm.\"\\nMary Kerrie's death hasn't yet been counted in the CDC's total. Her grieving family has many questions still without answers. But they believe that vaping THC is what ultimately led to her death.\\nFrom smoking to vaping\\nWhen Mary Kerrie transitioned to vaping nicotine a few years ago, she stopped smoking cigarettes completely, her daughter, Maggie Davis, said. Mary Kerrie was adamant with family and friends that vaping was healthier than smoking.\\n\"She thought it was safer,\" her husband, Kevin Davis, said. \"I certainly liked the fact that there wasn't the cigarette smell and her breath didn't smell like cigarettes. I kind of thought it was better, too.\"\\nMaggie remembers that her mom came to California this summer to help her move into her dorm for her senior year of college. While there, Mary Kerrie went to a vape shop and purchased THC cartridges for the first time.\\nImmediately upon returning home, she developed a nagging cough. Kevin didn't know Mary Kerrie had been vaping THC cartridges. Only after her death did the Davis family learn that Mary Kerrie had continued buying and using THC cartridges in Georgia. Unlike in California, THC is illegal in the Davis' home state.\\n'I hope you don't have that vaping disease'\\nMary Kerrie experienced a steady decline in health between the time she started vaping THC cartridges and her death. The initial health effects she had experienced from vaping to quit smoking transitioned into frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a terrible cough. They're all among the reported symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\nMary Kerrie went to the hospital for assessment on September 4. A flu swab tested negative. She texted her daughter that she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nMaggie had just begun hearing reports of a national outbreak of a mystery illness related to vaping. She texted her mom, \"I hope you don't have that vaping disease.\"\\nOn the way home from the hospital, groaning between coughs, Mary Kerrie said, \"I'm never smoking again. I'm throwing out all of my e-cigarettes and weed pens,\" Maggie wrote in a personal essay for her college newspaper.\\nKevin, an OB/GYN, encouraged Mary Kerrie when she declared she was quitting it all.\\nStill, Mary Kerrie's symptoms became worse over the next two days. She stayed home from social gatherings, telling her husband that she just needed rest.\\nHe felt she should be seen again by a doctor.\\nDays later, on September 6, Mary Kerrie was still sick. It was Kevin who found her, lips blue and gasping for breath, whispering, \"help.\"\\nOn the way to the hospital again, Mary Kerrie's pulse was barely detectable. She'd become unresponsive.\\nAt the hospital, doctors performed CPR unsuccessfully.\\nMoments later, Mary Kerrie -- an outgoing 52-year-old who loved rollerskating and mountain biking, a mother and wife who was known for being vivacious and happy -- was gone.\\n\"She will never see her youngest daughter graduate high school, nor her oldest graduate college,\" Maggie wrote after her death. \"She will never see her daughters married or meet her grandchildren. Her absence, a sudden and jarring hole in my family, will be felt for decades to come.\"\\nIn X-rays on the day Mary Kerrie presented at the hospital, her lungs had looked clear. Two days later, they revealed a white substance resembling clouds infiltrating Mary Kerrie's lungs.\\n'From healthy to drowning in your own lungs'\\nTo the Davis family, the X-rays seemed to confirm what they had heard in the news: Mary Kerrie's illness wasn't simply a case of pneumonia. In addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain, the whiteout in her lungs was one of the symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\n\"This wasn't a nursing home patient. This wasn't somebody with a chronic illness,\" Kevin said. \"You don't just go from healthy to drowning in your own lungs and a flatline EKG from things in your daily life.\"\\nNearly two months after Mary Kerrie's death, her case is still not part of the official CDC count of vaping-related lung injury deaths.\\nIn part, it speaks to just how new of a phenomenon this is. The ongoing investigation \"may take a few months\" and could yield \"multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\" CDC's Schuchat told reporters early in October.\\nFor the Davis family, the wait has been frustrating. To them, it seems obvious that Mary Kerrie's death is related to vaping.\\nKevin said he recently spoke with a CDC official who said that his wife's case met the agency's definition of a vaping-related illness, but the agency is waiting for the county medical examiner's decision before making an announcement.\\nThere have already been three confirmed vaping-related deaths in Georgia. If and when it is announced, Mary Kerrie's death could be the fourth, potentially making Georgia's death count the highest in the United States.\\nMary Kerrie's legacy\\nThe Davis family and Mary Kerrie's friends want her to be remembered for the good she brought into their lives.\\n\"She was all in on me and all in on our daughters, all in on her family. Anything that she wanted to be a part of, it was everything for her,\" Kevin said of their 24-year marriage. \"Her energy is beautiful, and I sure miss her.\"\\nThe Davis family attributes part of the blame for Mary Kerrie's death to a lack of regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration.\\n\"Marijuana pens also boast exponentially higher numbers of THC, and yet we still do not know how this historically disproportionate consumption of marijuana affects the human body, particularly when consumed as an oil,\" Maggie wrote.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA warned consumers to stop using THC vaping products as investigations into vaping-related lung injuries and deaths continue. Last week, the CDC made a similar warning, saying \"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC.\"\\n\"Mary Kerrie vaped [nicotine] products for several years I would say, successfully, and did quit smoking,\" Kevin said. \"I think when she was exposed to legal THC in California and then got illicit THC in Georgia ... I think that's what killed her.\"\\n\"Other people, if they're being exposed to something that can kill them, I hope they stop,\" Kevin said. \"I hope her passing helps somebody else.\"\\n  \n",

fundraising figure that he said was necessary in order to continue his campaign.\\nThe Castro campaign received more than $1 million in October from \"nearly 50,000 donors,\" according to a campaign statement, and on Thursday the campaign enjoyed its best fundraising day since August.\\nCastro had previously said that if he did not reach the $800,000 figure before the end of the month, he would have to end his 2020 bid. Fundraising has been a struggle for Castro, with the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor entering the fourth quarter of 2019 with less than $700,000 in the bank.\\n\"Time and time again this campaign has defied expectations with the support of an army of dedicated, grassroots supporters,\" Castro campaign manager Maya Rupert said in a statement Friday. \"We set an extremely ambitious goal to keep Secretary Castro's voice in this race, and our supporters met the challenge and delivered one of the best months of the campaign to date.\"\\nThe announcement of Castro's fundraising comes as the candidate heads to Iowa, a key early voting state, for the weekend to discuss affordable housing, according to the statement.\\nCastro has not yet qualified for the November debate, having failed to reach the 3% polling threshold despite meeting the donor requirement.\\n  \n",

              New York  (CNN Business)Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash pile keeps expanding, but Warren Buffett's industrial and insurance conglomerate has yet to make a major acquisition to ramp up growth.\\nBerkshire on Saturday reported it has $128 billion in cash, up from $122 billion in the second quarter.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has lagged the market this year, and Buffett has said that he wants to make an \"elephant\" sized acquisition with the company's mountain of cash. The problem is that the market rally has made any potential targets much more expensive, and Buffett has said he doesn't want to overspend on deals.\\nBerkshire's operating profit rose to $7.9 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year earlier, boosted by gains across its holdings. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's performance is tied to its many subsidiaries -- which include GEICO, railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe and consumer brands like Duracell, Dairy Queen and paint maker Benjamin Moore -- as well as a massive investment portfolio.\\nBerkshire also said tariffs from the US-China trade war weighed on its consumer and industrial businesses. The tariffs cut into sales of Precision Castparts, it gas turbine and pipe products unit, the filings said. BNSF railroad saw a 5% profit gain due to cost-cutting measures to offset a drag from trade tensions.\\nWhile Berkshire has yet to make a major acquisition, the company has been taking steps to embrace more reasonably valued tech stocks in recent years. Berkshire Hathaway still owns large stakes in value stalwarts like Coke, (KO) Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX) and Kraft Heinz, (KHC) which has taken billions of dollars in writedowns this year on some of its top brands.\\nBut the company's biggest holding now is Apple (AAPL), and Berkshire even has a small stake in Amazon (AMZN).\\nBerkshire Hathaway also purchased $700 million of its own stock in the third quarter, an uptick from the $442 million it bought last quarter. The company purchased $1.7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter.\\nPreviously, the company did not allow stock buybacks. The board changed a rule last year to allow the company to begin purchasing back billions of dollars worth of stock, a practice that has been criticized by some analysts as inflating share prices.\\n  \n",

Today, roughly one in every four orders at McDonald's includes a Happy Meal, according to retail data tracker Sense360. \\nEach Happy Meal contains the option of a hamburger or chicken nuggets, a side like french fries and a drink. And a toy, some of which have become collector's items. \\nMcDonald's is celebrating this milestone by re-releasing some of its most popular toys over the past four decades, including Ty Beanie Babies' Patti the Platypus and the Tamagotchi. Between November 7 through 11, McDonald's (MCD) will sell a \"Surprise Happy Meal\" in 90 countries that will include the throwback toys.\\nIt's the latest quick-service restaurant to tap into nostalgia to excite customers. Since fast-food customers are not particularly loyal to any brand,  fast-food companies must resort to marketing tactics or wacky food creations to draw in customers.\\nHere's a brief history of the Happy Meal:\\n1979\\nThe Circus Wagon Happy Meal, as it was originally known, launched in the United States in June 1979. The meal included a hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and cookies. Some of the early Happy Meal toys included a McDoodler stencil, McWrist wallet and a spinning top. The box became instantly recognizable with the meal. \\n1982\\nAfter becoming a hit in the United States, McDonald's expanded the meal internationally. It debuted first in Latin America before hitting Australia and New Zealand. \\n1984\\nMcDonald's added McNuggets as a Happy Meal option. The addition inspired a line of Happy Meal toys modeled after the McNuggets.\\n1991\\nMcDonald's partnered with United Airlines (UAL) to offer Happy Meals on some of its flights. The deal ended in 2001.\\n1998\\nThe first-ever global Happy Meal debuted with Disney film \"Mulan.\" The meal had identical packaging and toys across 40 countries.\\n2012 - 2013\\nAs its customers shifted toward healthier eating habits, McDonald's began overhauling the Happy Meal. In 2012, McDonald's made the french fries portion smaller, and it added fruit as an option. In 2013, it added milk or juice as beverage choices.\\n2018\\nMcDonald's said it would provide cheeseburgers in Happy Meals only upon request. It removed artificial preservatives from some of its entrees and added bottled water as a drink option. The company said that 3.4 billion fruit, low-fat dairy and water items have been served in Happy Meals in the US since 2013.\\n2020\\nStarting next year, McDonald's will add a new reduced-sugar and low-fat chocolate milk option. It has 25% less sugar compared to the previous version.\\n  \n",

Hasbro's chief rival, Mattel (MAT), enjoyed a sales surge of 3% over the same period. Both toy companies' success was largely tied to Toys \"R\" Us prior to the retailer's financial demise and rebirth.\\nThe revamped Toys \"R\" Us will open two streamlined locations ahead of Black Friday in Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and The Galleria in Houston.\\n\"We know that customers love shopping as a means of entertainment. That's something built into the DNA of human beings,\" Richard Barry, president and CEO of Toys \"R\" Us parent company, Tru Kids, told CNN Business. \"We also know kids and families are looking for things to do on the weekends or when school's out. We know parents and families really value play and the value of toys overall. As we thought about the strategy, we wanted to put all those things together.\"\\nThese are not simply stores, according to the company. The store chain will partner with the retail service startup B8ta to create hands-on, engaging experiences for kids and their parents, who may have fond memories of Toys \"R\" Us from their own childhoods.\\nThe old Toys \"R\" Us stores were 40,000-square-foot behemoths with merchandise stacked on endless rows of metal shelves. The new stores are about 6,500 square feet, with interactive spaces where kids and parents can play with toys.\\nThe revalitized Toys \"R\" Us website also showcases fewer toys, but gives more details on them. Those looking to purchase items are redirected to Target's (TGT) website, which provides inventory and fulfillment services.\\nB8ta, which designs interactive stores displays where shoppers can try the latest products, will bring theaters, video games, and other engaging items to the new Toys \"R\" Us stores.\\n\"We've got a huge treehouse in the middle of the store that kids will be able to climb into, an event space for movies in the store. We'll have great brands in the store,\" Barry said.\\nJohn Goodman, CEO of Candytopia, helped implement this \"shop-o-tainment\" idea two years ago before partnering with Toys \"R\" Us earlier this year to launch \"Toys R Us Adventure,\" a touring indoor play space appearing in select malls across the country for a limited time. The ticketed attraction costs $20 for children ages 4-12 and $28 for adults. It features toy-themed play areas for small children who, the company hopes, will bug their parents to buy them merchandise associated with the fun zones they've just finished exploring. \\nThese pop-up playlands aren't permanent stores. After about six months they will set up shop somewhere else.\\nGoodman, who previously served as CEO of The Gap (GPS), Kmart, and Sears, used a similar blueprint to help Candytopia founder Jackie Sorkin turn her birthday party and event business into a multi-million dollar, confection-themed touring attraction celebrated by celebrity influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore.\\nToys \"R\" Adventure's first run in Chicago and Atlanta generated national headlines last week as families celebrated the return of the familiar retail brand.  Pictures and videos of smiling, laughing children walking through imitation snow caves and interacting with the Toys \"R\" Us mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, are circulating now on Instagram and Facebook.\\nThe Toys \"R\" Us Adventure in Atlanta's Lenox Marketplace shopping complex was nearly filled to capacity, Goodman said. \\n\"We feel like we're adding a service to the mall in terms of driving additional traffic, anything from 1,700 to 2,200 people every single day,\" Goodman told CNN Business. \"It's like the circus. The circus comes to town and the circus leaves. It may or may not be back in a couple of years. That's how our model is built.\"\\nThis idea isn't exactly new, but it is catching on elsewhere. The minds behind New Jersey's new American Dream mall, which opened on Friday, came up with a similar concept. The Rutherford, New Jersey shopping complex is less a place to buy consumer goods and more of an indoor theme park with cartoon-themed attractions in its Nickelodeon Universe. It also has an indoor ski slope, a water park, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink.\\nScott Webb, CEO of the digital consulting firm Avionos, says this may be the future of toy-related, brick-and-mortar retail shopping. Encouraging kids to play with toys that aren't tied to TV, movie, or video game characters is crucial for the industry, which has struggled in an era when children binge watching shows on streaming services often avoid commercials advertising toys that they won't see on their favorite shows.\\n\"Kids as much as anything are digital consumers now,\" Webb told CNN Business. \"The Hasbro numbers back this up. The segments of toys that have really thrived are those tied to some intellectual property, whether it's Fortnite or Marvel or Star Wars.\" \\nWebb said Toys \"R\" Us turning its company into a toy discovery brand as opposed to a retailer may be a good strategy. \"I think they absolutely have a lot of brand equity to carve out a new niche in that role,\" he continued. \"But I think it would be hard to predict them ever discovering the same dominance in retail.\"\\n  \n",

And workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is expensive for grocers. That's why grocers are looking to technology to reduce costs and keep aisles from jamming up.\\n'Micro-fulfillment centers' \\nAlbertsons and Stop & Shop are testing automated \"micro-fulfillment centers\" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.\\nStop & Shop, owned by Dutch parent Ahold Delhaize, is building a 12,000-square-foot fully automated fulfillment center in the backroom of a store in Windsor, Connecticut, for deliveries in the Hartford area. Stop & Shop offers delivery through its online Peapod service.\\nMeijer announced this month that it will also begin testing micro-fulfillment with a logistics company to \"maximize space in our stores\" and expand online options, said Sid Handa, the company's director of strategic supply chain initiatives.\\nAnd in Salem, New Hampshire, Walmart is piloting a system with autonomous carts that gather customers' grocery orders and bring them to Walmart workers, who then prepare them for delivery or pickup.\\nSome analysts say these models are an advantage over large, centralized warehouses, which are often located further away from customers than stores. That's why micro-fulfillment centers can save grocers in delivery costs, according to experts.\\n\"Micro-fulfillment helps retailers solve the labor and last-mile costs conundrum,\" Christopher Mandeville, analyst at Jefferies, said in a research report earlier this month. \\nMandeville estimates that the cost of delivering groceries from central warehouses is usually around two times higher than using micro-fulfillment in stores. Jefferies cut Kroger's stock earlier this month in part because the company has invested in centralized facilities through a deal with Ocado, instead of micro-fulfillment.\\nGrocers are also moving the picking process out of stores entirely and testing so-called dark stores. Some dark stores have automation, while others are still manned by employees to do all of the picking of goods purchased online, said Mandeville.\\n\"Dark stores in grocery are an emerging trend,\" said Michael Demko, founder of grocery consulting firm Locai Solutions.\\nWalmart recently opened Walmart Pickup Point, a 40,000-square-foot prototype outside of Chicago at a former Dominick's grocery store. Customers drive up to the site to designated parking spots, and a Walmart worker loads up their trunk with their order. Walmart can also make deliveries from the location. \\nThe inside of the location looks like a Walmart with groceries and everyday items. Unlike a traditional Walmart supercenter, however, customers won't be able go inside.\\nStop & Shop has an approximately 40,000-square-foot dark store in Whitman, Massachusetts, on the site of a former grocery store tailored to make deliveries.\\nAnd Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, is testing four dark stores. The inside looks similar to a store but without signs, according to a spokesperson for the company.\\nThe locations are designed to fill shoppers' online orders while allowing traditional stores to \"continue to serve the needs of those who enjoy the in-store experience,\" the Hy-Vee spokesperson said.\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of Stop & Shop's 'dark store' in Massachusetts.\\n  \n",

(WIAT) — Liz Landgren has always loved to draw and paint, but she never realized she had a gift until adulthood. \\n“[I realized] it can be something that I can use for all kinds of things,” Landgren said.\\nThroughout her career, she’s painted all sorts of figures and creatures. But to her, no painting has ever been as important as her most recent piece: a portrait of Aniah Blanchard, the 19-year-old Southern Union student who has been missing for over a week. \\nAs she describes it, this painting had a mission.\\n“I thought ‘what can I do to make people look twice and look and see Aniah?'” she said.\\nAnd people have. \\nThe painting of Blanchard, a Homewood native, was the final product of a time-lapse video she made showing the process start to finish with fastidious attention paid to every detail. \\n\\nMISSING – Aniah Blanchard, from Homewood Alabama, went missing from AUBURN on Wednesday night.

Before the investigation began, Landgren says she didn’t know them personally, but that didn’t stop her from wanting to help. \\n“I don’t know, it’s just hit me so hard,” Landgren said with tears in her eyes. “She is one of our children. If this were my child, what would I want people to be doing? Everything. We’ve gotta find her. We’ve gotta find her. “\\nLangren said the community is welcome to download and share the Blanchard portrait across social media.\\n\\nThe investigation is ongoing and anyone with information regarding Aniah’s whereabouts, or other knowledge about the case is asked to call the Auburn Police Division Detective Section at 334-501-3140, the anonymous tip line at 334-246-1391 or the 24 hour non-emergency number at 334-501-3100. \\n\\nLATEST POSTS\\n‘Enough is enough’: Stop the Violence Conference held in Birmingham\\nPresident Trump declares November National Veterans and Military Families Month\\nTexas search group joins effort to find Aniah Blanchard\\nNix, No. 11 Auburn hold on, 20-14 over Ole Miss\\nNew Alabama Democratic Party chair elected after infighting\\n\\n\\n  \n",

Some experts believe it's because Closs is white and Fitts is black.\\nIn fact, data shows that missing white children receive far more media coverage than missing black and brown children, despite higher rates of missing children among communities of color.\\nThe FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database lists 424,066 missing children under 18 in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. About 37 percent of those children are black, even though black children only make up about 14 percent of all children in the United States.\\nIt's harder to say how many Hispanic kids are missing. The FBI's report groups white and Hispanic children together. Based on other reports, about 20 percent of missing children are Hispanic or Latino, according to Robert Lowery, vice president of the missing child division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). But the real number, he said, is likely higher.\\n\"I think there's a false belief that white children make up the biggest number of missing children when in fact (proportionally) it's just the opposite,\" Lowery said, adding that the high number of black girls reported missing is particularly concerning.\\nHere are some reasons experts say we don't hear more about missing children of color:\\nTheir families are hesitant to call police\\nSome families are hesitant to contact law enforcement, even if they think their child is missing.\\n\"There's a sense of distrust between law enforcement and the minority community,\" said Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation.\\nThat distrust contributes to a \"silent code of 'no snitching,'\" Wilson said, adding that it is important for people who suspect a child is missing to speak up.\\n\"It could be your child, your mother, your father that's missing,\" she said. \"You would want someone to speak up to help find them.\"\\nOther families might not report that their child is missing because they fear it could have unintended, negative consequences. \\nFor example, Lowery suspects missing Latino children are underreported because some families with undocumented members might not contact police for fear of being deported. \\nThey don't get as much media coverage\\nNews media organizations have often been criticized for not giving missing black children the amount of attention they give missing white kids. \\nA 2010 study found that black children were significantly underrepresented in TV news. Even though about a third of all missing children in the FBI's database were black, they only made up about 20 percent of the missing children cases covered in the news. \\nA 2015 study was bleaker: though black children accounted for about 35% of missing children cases in the FBI's database, they amounted to only 7% of media references.\\nExperts say media coverage is vital to helping solve those cases.\\n\"It puts law enforcement on alert, and they add additional resources to the case,\" Wilson said. \"If no one knows about it, then no one's doing anything to find them or to help them get the assistance they need.\"\\nFamilies don't have the resources\\nFamilies don't always have the financial resources to respond appropriately when their child is missing. They might not be able to afford a private investigator or take off from work to help look for their child and follow up with law enforcement and the media. \\nAnd in some cases, they may not know what to do.\\nWilson said some people are under the misconception that they must wait 48 hours before filing a police report, when that waiting period varies by location. Places like Illinois or Washington, DC, don't have waiting periods to report a child missing.\\nKnowing the laws in your state helps. And when in doubt, contact law enforcement immediately. \\nThere are other resources that families can utilize as well.\\nThe Black and Missing Foundation helps families of color file police reports, create missing posters and spread the word about missing children.\\nFacebook groups offer an online community for parents to alert the public about their missing child and ask questions of others who have had similar experiences. \\nEliseo Montoya, who runs the Facebook group Runaway and Missing Children in California, said he keeps the page going because it allows families to feel like they're doing something even when it seems like authorities are giving up. \\n\"A page like mine is very important for people of color because nobody really embraces people of color,\" Montoya said.\\nSome get classified as runaways\\nWhen most people think of missing children, they think of young children abducted by strangers. But missing children can refer to kids who are abducted by relatives or children who leave home, either voluntarily or after being lured by someone else.\\nMany missing children of color are classified as runaways, Wilson said. And while running away from home isn't a problem unique to nonwhite children, they are particularly vulnerable. \\nA significant number of nonwhite children who go missing are either homeless or in foster care, said Wilson, and many are at risk for sex trafficking. Data shows black children are overrepresented in foster care and are at a much higher risk for homelessness. \\nLaw enforcement often classify children of color as runaways without having all the details, Wilson said. Because those kids are considered to have voluntarily left home, Amber alerts aren't sent out about them and they typically aren't covered in the news. \\nRunaway cases and abductions by family members don't get the same attention that abductions by non-family members or strangers do. But all these scenarios fall under the \"missing\" umbrella. A child is missing if they are under the age of 18 and their legal guardian doesn't know where they are.\\nThe NCMEC no longer distinguishes between runaways and abductions on their posters of missing children.\\n\"Frankly, we were dealing with a desensitized public and media when we did that,\" Lowery said. \"Now if you check our website, our children are just listed as missing child.\"\\nWilson stressed that runaway cases should be treated with the same urgency.\\n\"We have to be mindful,\" she said. \"What did they leave from, and what are they ultimately running to?\"\\nSometimes, children of color get classified as runaways when they are truly missing. Wilson said her organization has seen many such cases. \\n\"We tell parents all the time, you know your child better than anyone else, their behavior, their characteristics,\" she said. \"If you believe your child did not run away, you just have to stand firm with law enforcement and let them know that this is uncharacteristic of your child.\" \\n  \n",

Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?\\nThe answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\\nConsider what we've seen just since Friday:\\n1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card\\n2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\\n3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \\n4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\\n5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\\n6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \\n7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails\\nAnd in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\\nThe rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.\\nAt one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\\nAnd the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\\nFrom a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \\nBut by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\\nEven for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.\\nNow consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\\nThe real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?\\n  \n",

acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney testify on Capitol Hill on Friday, ratcheting up their investigation to target the President's top aide.\\nThe House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees sent Mulvaney a letter Tuesday requesting he appear for a closed-door deposition as part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. \\n\"We believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the House's impeachment inquiry,\" the Democratic chairs wrote.\\nIt appears unlikely that Mulvaney will comply with the request. \\nSo far this week, six Trump administration officials have defied requests for their testimony, and several more are expected to do the same later this week, including Energy

Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\\nWilliams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\\nPence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\\nLawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.\\nOver a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\\nSince then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\\nThe three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nCurrent and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\\nThe official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces.

That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \\nKentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \\nYet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \\nIf Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \\nThe same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \\nThe polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \\nYou can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \\nHood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \\nAfter the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \\nIf there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \\nThose slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \\nWere Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\\nI would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \\nStill, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\\n  \n",

The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. \\nAll eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates.\\nHere's a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: \\nKentucky governor \\nRepublican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state's attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   \\nTrump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor's office in the state. \\nTrump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin's victory came within 10 points of his opponent.\\nMedicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.\\nIn 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\\nBeshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \\nPolls close at 6 p.m. local time. \\nMississippi governor\\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  \\nTrump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \\nCook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\\nHood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \\nThere is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nVice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. \\nVirginia legislature \\nRepublicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\\nDemocrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\\nDemocrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.\\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.\\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET.\\n  \n",

And now it's the President who is leading the attack. \\n\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \\nHe's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\\nBut the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \\nThere are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\\nWhen that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\\nKohn added: \"If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\\nAnd Trump has made clear where he stands. \\nHe wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\\n\"It's a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\\nBut certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\\nThe whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\\nHarassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\\n\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\\nDevine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\\nHe ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\\nBut that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\\nAnd then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\\nBut no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \\n\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\\nToobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\\n\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\\nBut that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\\nUltimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\\n  \n",

They are also alleged to have aided Giuliani, the President's personal attorney, in efforts to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe video of the rally is the latest example of how the pair who had little record of donations to candidates before 2018, wielded their proximity to Giuliani and used political donations to gain access to the president and political campaigns. Photos and videos throughout 2018 and 2019 show the pair traveling with the former New York City mayor throughout the world and to political events across the country.\\nThe footage was found by CNN's KFile during a review of the travel and political activity of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman.\\nParnas and Fruman were arrested in October attempting to leave the country. They were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week to the charges. Parnas and Fruman were ordered to house confinement and subject to GPS monitoring after they each secured a $1 million bond. \\nIn the videos, Parnas sits in the area directly behind Trump before and during the rally.  Parnas, who at times is wearing a blue hat and glasses, can be seen apparently taking a video of the President on his cellphone as he walks up the stairs to the stage.\\nAt another point, Parnas leaves the area behind the podium to be along the path of the Trump's exit at the bottom of the stage. He waves to the president as he leaves, and the president waves back in the direction of Parnas and the crowd.\\nIt is unclear how Parnas, who is not a Nevada native, got into the prized seating area directly behind the President. A photo from Parnas' Instagram featured in a video by the Wall Street Journal shows he appeared to have a VIP badge for the event.\\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman since their indictment.\\n\"I don't know those gentlemen,\" the President said earlier this month. \"Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here.\"\\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump added. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do but I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy, I just don't know.\"\\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman returned a request for comment. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. A lawyer for Fruman did not return a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. \\nRally mentioned in indictments\\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York described the October 2018 rally in the 21-page indictment of Parnas, Fruman and their associates David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were both indicted on a conspiracy charge. Correia and Kukushkin have also pleaded not guilty.\\nThe prosecutors wrote that \"on or about October 20, 2018,\" Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for \"Candidate-1\" in Nevada and took photos with \"Candidate-2.\" The trio then sent the photographs to \"Foreign National-1,\" whose identity has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe candidates were later identified as Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wesley Duncan. Trump appeared at the rally to campaign for Laxalt. A photo from Parnas' now-private Instagram, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal, shows him and Fruman posing for a photograph with Laxalt previously during a September 2018 fundraiser. A spokesperson for Laxalt told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he \"doesn't know the man.\"\\nOne of several midterm events attended by Parnas and Fruman  \\nThe Trump rally in Nevada was one of many events attended by Fruman and Parnas in the final weeks heading up the November 2018 midterm elections.\\nIn photos posted on Twitter, Parnas and Fruman can be seen accompanying Giuliani to events in Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Indiana and again in Nevada.\\nA November 3, 2018, tweet of a several photos from Michigan Senate candidate John James shows James sitting at a table with Giuliani and Parnas. In another photo, James can be seen speaking while Fruman sits in the first row of seats and Parnas stand with Giuliani off to the side. \\nPictures tweeted that same day from Giuliani and congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian show Giuliani with Parnas and Fruman while campaigning in Nevada. A video from that morning also shows Fruman and Parnas with Giuliani as he campaigns in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun.\\nAnother campaign event for then-Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on November 4, 2018, shows Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman among attendees according to photos shared from DeSantis's Twitter account.\\nParnas was also seen with Giuliani at campaign events for New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Eddie Edwards. Photos posted on Twitter show Edwards and Giuliani addressing supporters at several campaign events on November 5, 2018 -- the day before the midterm election -- with Parnas standing near Giuliani.\\n  \n",

                                     (CNN)A new survey of likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers from the New York Times and Siena College finds a tight top tier of four in Iowa, with no clear leader in the first state to weigh in on the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\nIn Friday's poll, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has the support of 22%, with a tight cluster of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (19%), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and Former Vice President Joe Biden (17%) all within striking distance of Warren.\\nThe results in the early voting state do not bode well for Biden and are similar to a September CNN/Des Moines Regiser/Mediacom poll in which Warren challenged Biden's dominance in the race. \\nThis also marks a jump for Buttigieg, who previously lagged behind the three longstanding frontrunners and clocked in at 9% in CNN's poll in Iowa last month.\\nBehind them, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar lands at 4%, and California Sen. Kamala Harris and businessman Andrew Yang at 3% each in Friday's poll. The poll is Klobuchar's second poll that meets the standard to qualify for the December Democratic presidential debate, which requires 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC's criteria or 6% in two early state polls between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12.\\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Tom Steyer all garnered 2% of support.\\nTwo-thirds of likely caucusgoers in the poll said they could still change their minds about whom to support.\\nThe Times/Siena survey was conducted from Oct. 25-30, questioned 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\\n  \n",

                              Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's campaign says House Democrats' vote to formally launch an impeachment inquiry has only emboldened the President's supporters and bolstered their campaign contributions. \\n\"Nancy Pelosi's impeachment resolution day turned into a MASSIVE fundraising day for ??@realDonaldTrump?,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Friday morning. \\nAccording to Parscale, the campaign raised $3 million online in one day, totaling $19 million in funds raised over the course of the month. \\nThe $3 million addition came the same day the House passed the resolution, which the campaign called a \"sham.\" \\n\"Today's vote merely proves that the entire impeachment process was a sham from the beginning and Nancy Pelosi can't legitimize it after the fact,\" Parscale said in a statement following the resolution vote. \"Voters will punish Democrats who support this farce and President Trump will be easily re-elected.\"\\nTrump's one-day haul highlights his campaign's heavy use of digital advertising to reach potential supporters and donors -- a year ahead of the 2020 election.\\nThe campaign's heaviest spending isn't in swing states, such as Michigan or Pennsylvania, but in donor-rich parts of the country, such as Texas and California, according to a CNN tally of Facebook advertising data compiled by the Democratic-leaning firm Bully Pulpit Interactive.\\nThe Lone Star State received the biggest share of Facebook spending by the Trump campaign and its affiliated Trump Make America Great Again Committee since late March of this year -- nearly 9% of its total spending on the platform, the data show.\\nThe fundraising bump also came during the final days of the month, a period when nearly all active political campaigns rally supporters to ramp up contributions ahead of the close of the monthly report to the Federal Election Commission. The campaign push, in the final week of this month, included offers to triple and even quintuple all donations.  \\nThe Trump campaign has been positioning itself this fall to be ready to capitalize on Trump's perceived accomplishments and political battles. \\nDuring the final game of the World Series earlier this week, the campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy, airing a video nationally which checked off the President's accomplishments and went after his Washington rivals. It focuses on Trump's efforts to combat ISIS and boost the economy, and it also highlights his battles with Democrats and the Russia investigation.\\nOn Friday, a day after the House vote, Facebook ads from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee asked supporters to \"add your name\" to the people willing to \"Stand with President Trump\" in the face of the impeachment inquiry.\\nSupporters then are encouraged to leave their names, email addresses, ZIP codes and mobile numbers.\\nIn a recent conference call with reporters, a Trump official called the reelection effort a \"digital first campaign\" that can swiftly seize on fast-moving news, such as developments in the impeachment inquiry, to target voters and test and tweak advertising messages on digital platforms.\\n\"They are running a highly sophisticated operation,\" Reid Vineis, vice president for digital at Republican ad-buying firm Majority Strategies, said of the Trump operation. \"The Trump campaign has been essentially building a database for the 2020 general election.\"\\nOf particular value: The campaign's collection of mobile phone numbers.\\n\"Politics is much more effective at a one-to-one level,\" Vineis said. \"Text messages are read almost 100% of the time.

Now the results of a recent trial at Microsoft (MSFT) suggest it could work even for the biggest businesses.\\nThe company introduced a program this summer in Japan called the \"Work Life Choice Challenge,\" which shut down its offices every Friday in August and gave all employees an extra day off each week.\\nThe results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year, the company said in a statement last week. \\nIn addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails. \\nThey suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft's, of course).\\nThe effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft's 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company. \\nBy shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity. \\nThe initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — culture of overwork. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: karoshi means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.\\nThe issue attracted international attention in 2015, when an employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu committed suicide on Christmas Day. Tokyo officials later said that the staffer had worked excessive amounts of overtime.\\nTwo years later, a reporter at a Japanese broadcaster died after working punishing long hours. Her employer said she had clocked in 159 hours of overtime the month before her death.\\nThat has led businesses to start searching for solutions. Some companies have begun offering employees more flexibility, and the government has launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday,\" which encourages workers to leave early every last Friday of the month.\\nMicrosoft, for its part, says it will conduct another experiment in Japan later this year. It plans to ask employees to come up with new measures to improve work-life balance and efficiency, and will also ask other companies to join the initiative.\\n  \n",

Plans for the store were announced in September.\\nThe new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company's vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want \"convenience, comfort and connection\" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. \\nYoung said the store is meant to be \"predictable and effortless\" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. \\nThe store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe's 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. \\nThe design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.\\nCustomers aren't required to order from Starbucks' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. \\nThe digitally focused store is part of the company's goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. \\nStarbucks Pick-Up will help the company \"test and learn\" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.\\nThe new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That's a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. \\nStarbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It's similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. \\nCEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' earnings call this week that it's \"seeing encouraging early results\" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China's largest cities. \\nBoth Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company's portfolio of stores that are \"tuned to different needs at different times,\" Young said. \\nOn the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world's largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November. The four-story Chicago location is 43,000 square feet and is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location on the city's Magnificent Mile.\\n  \n",

But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple's starting model, you'll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple's original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product. \\nIn a sense, this is Apple (AAPL) doing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones. \\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes, mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple's rivals. It's a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it's become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple's product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\\n Apple hasn't shared how many AirPods it's sold, but the company's wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it's hard not to believe it. \\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned, with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it's tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it's like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ. \\nFor those moments when you don't want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people's voices without sacrificing what you're listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual's ear canal's shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud. \\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it's still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem. \\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car. \\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I'd argue he's right.

Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \\nHere's what Paul said:\\n\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'\"\\nPaul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\\nWhile that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\\nWhat Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\\nThat's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\\nHere's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\\nThe task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\\nTo date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\\nFixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\\nBut thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\\nWhat Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\\nIt's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\\nTo which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\\n  \n",

Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\\nI asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\nCillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\\nBailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\\nBevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\\nGoforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.\\nAttorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\\nCillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\\nBailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\\nBut there are some clear differences between the two. \\nThe President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\\nBevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\\nCillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\\nBailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\\nAndy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\\nHe also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\\nCillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\\nBailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\\nBailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\\nThe President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\\nTrump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\\n  \n",

You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You're read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\\nThat response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\\nA bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\\nOn Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \\n\"If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!\".\\nAnd then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \\n\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\\nPresumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\\nWhich is fine! And smart!\\n(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\\nBut if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \\nThink of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\\nThat's not to say Trump's \"real\" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.\\nAnd honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\\nWhy haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\\nNo matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\\n  \n",

Hampshire and South Carolina as he fights to keep his campaign afloat, a Castro aide tells CNN.\\nThe teams in the two early nominating states were told they were being let go on Monday. Their last days at work will be next week, the aide said.\\nThis comes after CNN first reported on Saturday that the Castro campaign was looking to downsize, supporting staffers looking for other jobs and pivoting their focus to Iowa, Nevada and Texas.\\n\"In pushing to keep Secretary Castro's critical voice in this race, our campaign, like many others, will make adjustments in staffing and resources,\" Hackett said, in response to a story first reported by Politico. \"This race is shifting as we speak, and Julián will continue to be fearless and defy expectations by making the most of our resources.\"\\nSome Castro aides outside of New Hampshire and South Carolina have taken the campaign up on that offer and other campaigns have received inquiries from would-be former Castro aides.\\nAll of this is a bid to keep Castro's campaign solvent as the former Housing and Urban Development secretary works to qualify for the November debate, something he has yet to do.\\nCastro has struggled for months to raise money or get attention in the still large field of Democrats vying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.\\nBut the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.\\nCastro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.\\n  \n",

said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are \"legally invalid\" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.\\nThe guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.\\nImpeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.\\nIn the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\\nThe five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.\\nOLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\\nThe administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\\nThe memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\\n  \n",

Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\\n\"I say to tonight to the media: do your job and print his name,\" Paul, a Kentucky Republican, yelled during a rally Trump held in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin ahead of Tuesday's gubernatorial election. The crowd of Trump supporters, many donning \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT\" shirts, erupted into applause and cheers, and some chanted \"Do your job!\" and pointed toward the area where members of the press gathered to cover the event.\\nPaul told the crowd \"we also now know the name of the whistleblower,\" but did not provide any personal knowledge of the person's identity, before going on to echo baseless claims of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \"The whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,\" Paul said. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\nSeveral other Republicans have called for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator's insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\\nDuring the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\nThe anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\\nOn Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \\nZaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.\\nIn September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.\\nTwo sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\\n'Deeply troubling and disappointing' \\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.\\n\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,\" King said. \\n\"It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \\nLater on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\\nRaskin argued that the \"attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic\" that is a \"distraction from the merits of the case.\"\\n  \n",

But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \\nTalks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. \\nThat room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\\nAnd, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\\n\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\\nSenate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.\\nSchumer's office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House's impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.\\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\\nSchumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\\nA key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\\nThere is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections.

They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. \\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" He claimed that the \"many people\" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.\\nThen he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\\nBreaking down Trump's comments\\nHere is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \\n\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\\nGot that?\\nLet's break it down claim by claim.\\n1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.\\n2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\\n3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\\n4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\\nIn summary: Trump went from\\nA) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to\\nB) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\\nC) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \\nD) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\\nHe can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:\\nA fact check\\nAs Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" \\nThe Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call's aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\\nThe whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \\nThe White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \\nTrump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\\nIt was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\\n  "

Those dams are \"reviewed periodically\" and rated according to the age and condition of the dam, in addition to potential consequences. The federal agency's dams range from low to \"very high urgency of action.\"\\nIn the wake of Friday's announcement, the Corps also said that it is \"actively coordinating\" with partners and coordinating public outreach as part of interim risk-management strategies.\\n\"We're working closely with San Bernardino County, Apple Valley, Victorville, Hesperia and other downstream agencies to improve flood-risk awareness and emergency preparedness,\" said Kristen Bedolla, Dam Safety Program manager for the LA District. \"Community preparation also is a key component in reducing flood risk.â?\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nClaudia Cowan reports from Oroville\\nIn May, the Corps upgraded the risk characterization of Prado Dam to high urgency.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\\nA 15-year-old boy appeared in court Saturday on attempted murder charges for allegedly shooting a 7-year-old girl while she was out trick-or-treating.\\nChicago police identified the suspect in the Halloween shooting of the girl, who was dressed a bumblebee andÂ out collecting candy, and a 32-year-old man. The girl was shot in the right side of her neck andÂ upper chest and remains in critical condition, and the man was shot in his left hand.\\nPolice said the man and the girl were not together and have no relationship. They said the man shot was not the intended target, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\\nThe teen, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, faces two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery through discharge of a firearm, according to a Friday release by Chicago police. Judge Joanne Rosado also told him he is charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, according to the Chicago Tribune.Â Heâ??ll be held in detention at least until a second hearing on Monday.\\nCALIFORNIA HALLOWEEN PARTY SHOOTING LEAVES AT LEAST 4 DEAD\\nThe shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. when threeÂ people walked up to another group of people in an alley in Chicagoâ??s Little Village neighborhood on the southwest side. Assistant stateâ??s attorney Jack Ruggiero told the court the boy and several others, at least one of whom was wearing a mask, went out that day â??looking for troubleâ? and looking for a Latin King (member of a Hispanic Chicago street gang). The shooting occurred close to the border dividing rival street gangs.\\nWhen they spotted the 32-year-old man on the otherÂ side of the alley as the little girl, one of them first tried to shake his hand. They informed him they were Gangster Two-Six members and then chased him, yelling â??Two-six!â? and â??King Killa!â? before the suspect fired seven times, hitting the man and the child.\\nAfter the shooting, the boy fled down another alley. The group listened to a police scanner and learned the little girl was shot. According to Ruggiero, the boy â??urinated on his handsâ? after learning about the girl to try to get the gunpowder off his hands. The boy told members of his group to â??hide the jacketâ? he was wearing.\\nRuggiero said police found the gun used in the attack after witnesses heard the boy say he tossed the gun in an alley near garbage cans and a school before he ran away. Video surveillance recorded him hiding the gun there.\\nThe suspect was arrested around 1:30 a.m. Friday.\\nâ??He transformed (the street) into a real-life horror movie,â? Ruggiero said. â??He showed complete disregard for human life,â? when he fired a gun seven times, Ruggiero added.\\nEVIDENCE IN MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER IS INSURMOUNTABLE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAYS\\n\"This minor didnâ??t care about the 7-year-old girl,'' Ruggiero said. He \"involved himself'' in a gang conflict.\\nThe boyâ??s defense attorney John Miraglia said in court the boy â??absolutelyâ? denies the charges. He said the boy has no â??publishableâ? background and said his parents are â??good people.â? His mother and stepfather appeared in court but gave no comment.\\nThe boyÂ spoke quietly during the hearing, mostly giving the judge yes or no answers. As Judge Rosado read the charges, he said â??I have a question,â? but the judge did not allow him to elaborate. The boy twisted around to look at his mother, who nodded several times at him as he was taken back into custody.\\nFamily members of the girl who was shot prayed outside Stroger hospital, where she was being cared for, Thursday night.Â â??The family of the 7-year-old girl who was shot in Little Village is grateful for the outpouring of love and support shown by all of Chicago and the nation. She remains in serious condition. At this time, the family is requesting privacy,â? a Cook County health department statement said.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nLocal resident Jose Vazquez told the Sun-Times the sceneÂ of the attack has been a hotbed for violence. \"That alley is crazy,â? he said.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Talk radio host Dana Loesch argues 2020 White House hopeful Julian Castro is a 'hypocrite' on the subject after his remarks on gun control at the Democrat primary debate.\\nMANCHESTER, N.H. â?? Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro is laying off his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two of the first four early-voting states in the primary and caucus nominating season.\\nThe former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing secretary in then-President Barack Obamaâ??s cabinet will now focus his campaign on Iowa, which kicks off the nominating calendar, and Nevada, which votes third. The news â?? first reported by Politico â?? was confirmed early Tuesday by Fox News with a source close to the Castro campaign. The small staffs in both New Hampshire and South Carolina were notified on Monday.\\nCASTRO REACHES FUNDRAISING GOAL, STAYING IN 2020 RACE\\nThe move by the Castro campaign comes just a few days after it announced on Friday that it brought in $800,000 in the last 10 days of October, a haul Castro had said was necessary to continue his uphill bid for the Democratic nomination.\\nBut reaching that goal didnâ??t erase the steep fundraising hurdles facing the campaign. Castro, who launched his longshot bid last December, has frequently spotlighted his underdog status as he runs for the nomination against many much better-known and better-funded rivals.\\nCastro made the stage for the first four rounds of Democratic presidential primary debates, but has yet to qualify for the fifth round, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia. The candidate has reached the individual donor threshold but remains short of reaching the polling criteria.\\nIn a fundraising email on Monday, CastroÂ campaign officials warned that their candidate was in jeopardy of not making the debate stage and said that they were â??launching IMMEDIATE digital adsâ? to help them clinch â??the final polls Julian needs to qualify.â?\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\nCastro, the only Latino among the major Democratic White House hopefuls, will now pour his remaining resources into Iowa â?? where he launches a five-figure ad buy on Tuesday â?? and Nevada. Heâ??ll also concentrate on his native Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, directly after the early voting states. The other Texan in the nomination race,Â former Rep. Beto Oâ??Rourke,Â ended his White House bid on Friday. \\nCastro raised roughly $3.5 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, but spent nearly $4 million in the same period. Castro has just $670,000 cash on hand at the start of October, but raised $1 million last month.\\n\\n      Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro signs the famed wooden eggs as he headlines 'Politics and Eggs' at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, NH in January, 2019\\n      \\nEyebrows were raised in New Hampshire in recent days as Castroâ??s campaign had yet to schedule a date for their candidate to file in person to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. The source close to the campaign said it was unclear if Castro would file in person.\\nKAMALA HARRIS LAYS OFF STAFF, SHUTS OFFICES, IN NH\\nThe move by Castro follows a similar step made last week by Sen. Kamala Harris. The California Democrat, hemorrhaging campaign cash, dramatically cut her staff in New Hampshire and closed all of her field offices in the first primary state, as she continues to concentrate all of her resources on Iowa.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says aid was withheld due to concerns of corruption in Ukraine and concerns that European nations weren't contributing their fair share; Kristin Fisher reports.\\nHouse committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump have requested that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appear before the panels for a deposition on Friday, claiming that he was â??directly involvedâ? in the Ukraine controversy which sparked the proceedings.\\nHouse Intelligence Committee ChairÂ Adam Schiff, Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel penned a letter to Mulvaney on Tuesday, requesting his appearance at a deposition as part of the impeachment inquiry this Friday at 9 a.m.\\nNEW DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED\\nâ??Based on evidence gathered in the impeachment inquiry and public reporting, we believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the Houseâ??s impeachment inquiry,â? they wrote.\\nâ??Specifically, the investigation has revealed that you may have been directly involved in an effort orchestrated by President Trump, his personal agent, Rudolph Giuliani, and others to withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trumpâ??s personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so,â? they continued.\\nThe request for Mulvaneyâ??s deposition comes amid the Houseâ??s formal impeachment inquiry into the president. The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky toÂ investigateÂ former Vice President Joe Biden and hisÂ son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\\nA transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\\nIn the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced â??evidence,â? such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaneyâ??s role in Trumpâ??s conversations with Zelensky.\\nâ??â?¦Bolton told a National Security Council staffer â??to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaneyâ?? Â to pressure Ukraine for political help,â? they wrote.\\nâ??Ambassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the Presidentâ??s scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, â??I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,â??â? they wrote. â??The â??drug dealâ?? appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.â?\\nThe chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing â??a central roleâ? in the presidentâ??s move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.\\nâ??You admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the Presidentâ??s own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,â? they wrote.\\nDuring a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White Houseâ??s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\\nâ??We do that all the time with foreign policy,â? Mulvaney said. â??And I have news for everybody: Get over it. Thereâ??s going to be political influence in foreign policy.â?\\nMulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.\\nâ??Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trumpâ??s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the Presidentâ??s 2020 re-election campaign,â? they wrote.\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\\nFox News' Chad Pergram and John Roberts contributed to this report.Â \\n</td>\n",

Trump also appeared to suggest that he has information that a recent witness, Lt. Col. Â Alexander Vindman, is a â??Never-Trumper.â? He was asked about any evidence he may have about Vindman and he responded, Â â??Weâ??ll be showing that to you real soon.â?\\nVindman, who serves as a director on the National Security Council (NSC), testified last week in a closed-door hearing about his concerns about the presidentâ??s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr and a prior meeting with Ambassador Sondland about investigating Joe Biden and his son. A whistleblower's complaint about the phone call is at the center of House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of the president. Trump has denied any wrongdoing suggested that the impeachment investigation is simply another attempt by Democrats to damage his presidency after the Mueller report fell short.

       "      <td>President Trump's legacy in the judicial branch of the government is heading for a historic milestone. With several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees could soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench.\\nPresident Trump is on his way to reaching a significant mark in his presidency, asÂ his latest nominees for federal appeals courtsÂ go through the confirmation process.\\nWith several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees couldÂ soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench. Out of 179 Circuit Court positions, 43 are occupied by Trump picks, with four current vacancies and another five spots opening up due to upcoming retirements.\\nTRUMP JUDICIAL PICK BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AT HEARING OVER LEGAL GROUPâ??S ATTACK\\nâ??This is an exciting milestone for the president,â? Judicial Crisis Network policy director Carrie Severino told Fox News.\\nWhile a number of Trumpâ??s picks are filling seats previously held by judges appointed by Republican presidents, many are taking the place of liberal jurists appointed by Democrats. The Ninth Circuit, for example, once known as a staunchly liberal Court of Appeals, is gradually evening out. Trump has already placed six judges on the Ninth Circuit bench, which currently has one vacancy and will have two more in the near future.\\nShould Trump fill all three spots, he will have chosen nearly a third of the roster with nine out of 29 judges.\\nSeverino described Trumpâ??s appellate nominees as â??exceptional,â? while stressing their independence.\\nâ??Thatâ??s the kind of judge America wants,â? Severino said, claiming that the ability to select judges for lifetime positions is a significant part of why Trump was elected in 2016.\\nTRUMP NOMINATES WAVE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES, IN FRESH BID TO RESHAPE COURTS\\nDemocrats have been fierce in their opposition to several of Trumpâ??s selections. Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counselâ??s office.Â A segment on Rachel Maddowâ??s MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled \"Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy.\"Â Maddow cited Menashiâ??s use of the term â??ethnonationalismâ? to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on theÂ â??fringe of racial thinking.â?\\nDuring questioning, Sen.Â Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that MenashiÂ had faced â??unusually personalâ? and â??viciousâ? attacks.\\nMenashi denied the allegations, saying, â??Itâ??s hurtful and I think it misrepresents what Iâ??ve written.â?\\nDuring his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on â??constitutional traditions.\"\\nMenashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.\\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as â??Well Qualified,â? its highest mark.\\nThe ABAâ??s rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a â??Not Qualifiedâ? rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\\nThe ABAâ??s letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigantsÂ and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had runÂ against VanDyke for a judicial position.\\nAdditionally, multiple people who were interviewed by the ABA for VanDykeâ??s evaluation told Fox News that they gave positive reviews and were surprised by the ABAâ??s findings.\\nAddressing the accusations in the ABAâ??s letter, specifically his supposed stance towards the LGBTQ community, VanDyke broke down in tears in the middle of his hearing, denying the allegation.\\nâ??No, I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God. They should all be treated with dignity and respect,â? he said.\\nDespite opposition from the left, Trumpâ??s picks are likely to be confirmed due to the Senateâ??s Republican majority. \\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nMike Davis, president of The Article III Project, which works to help secure the confirmation of Trumpâ??s picks, noted that the presidentâ??s success in this area fulfills one of his 2016 campaign promises.\\nâ??President Trump has delivered on his promise to American voters,â? Davis said, pointing to Trumpâ??s appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, â??and an all-time-record number of circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals.â?\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Even Democrats are taking notice of the estimated price tag. Dr. Vin Gupta weighs in.\\nAs \"Medicare-for-all\" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary,Â a new report released by the British government on itsÂ National Health Service, or NHS,Â offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.\\nThe reportÂ on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, detailsÂ increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visitsÂ to cancer care.Â And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.\\n\"Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,\" the report also declares.\\nAn American \"Medicare-for-all\" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system.Â Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.\\nBut the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range ofÂ Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth WarrenÂ haveÂ captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.\\nCritics in the United States have saidÂ that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.\\n\"Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'\" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday.Â \"Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.'Â But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?\\n\"Thereâ??s a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren wonâ??t admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.\"\\nThe reportÂ on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standardsÂ in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.\\n\"In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,\" the report says of cancer wait times. \"During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded. The target of 85% has been missed for all but one month since April 2014.\"\\n\\n      A chart from the British House of Commons shows increased wait times for \"accident and emergency\" care in English hospitals over time.\\n      (House of Commons)\\nWARREN UNDER FIRE ON 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' AS SHE NOW CLAIMS BILLIONAIRES ALONE CAN FUND IT\\nPatients whose general practitioner refers them to a consultant, the report continues, are also waiting longer.\\nWhile the report is largely negative, it notes some positive indicators -- including an increase in the number of doctors and nurses in recent years.\\nThe British NHS provides health care for all for no cost at the point of delivery, which isÂ similar to what Sanders and Warren aim for with \"Medicare-for-all.\" It is funded through general taxation, meaning every taxpayer chips in to fund the program.\\n\\n      A surgical team prepare a patient ahead of performing an operation at Milton Keynes University Hospital in Milton Keynes, central England, Britain, May 23, 2018.

OneÂ child is currently missing, and authorities are searching the mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border for the child.\\nThose attacked were members of the LeBaron family, a well-known American clan who hasÂ lived in the community in the northern part of the country for decades, according toÂ The New York Times.Â The attack targeted citizens who live in a community founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\n\"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,\" Trump tweeted. \"We merely await a call from your great new president!\"\\nPresident AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador refused that approach, however, saying at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\"\\n\"We declared war, and it didn't work,\" Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. \"That is not an option.\"\\nTrump has repeatedly raised concerns about levels of gang violence and drug-related crime in Mexico, particularly as it relates to securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The two countries have stepped up cooperation on that front over the summer, with asylum seekers being returned to Mexico to await hearings, while Mexico has also increased its troop presence on both its northern and southern borders.\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nEarly reports indicated the tragedy could have been a case of mistaken identity, but recent history also raises the possibility the LeBaron family was the intended target: only a decade ago, two members of the family opposed to local drug trafficking groups were kidnapped and murdered, according to the New York Times.\\nMexico's federal Department of Security and Citizens' Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area following \"the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people.\" The troops were searching for the missing community members, believed to include 11 children or more.\\nA number of Republicans backed Trump's call for action in Mexico in response to the massacre. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said that Mexico is \"dangerously closeÂ to being a failed state.\"\\n\"This is what happens when Mexicoâ??s politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power. Enough. Mexicoâ??s president hasnâ??t taken the threat seriously and innocent American lives have been lost again. The Mexican government must partner with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to wage a full-scale offensive against these butchers,â? he said.\\nSen.

Tuesday will decide whether to make the liberal enclave Arizona's only sanctuary city in a rebuke to President Trumpâ??s immigration policies and a tough state anti-illegal immigration law that drew international condemnation nearly a decade ago. \\nThe measure, Proposition 205, would put new restrictions on when police can inquire about immigration status or cooperate with federal law enforcement.\\n\\n      Tucson voters will decide Tuesday whether to declare itself a sanctuary city.Â \\n      (tucsonaz.gov)\\nTucson progressives say the measure will send a clear message to the Trump administration and give a voice to the city's sizable Latino community. \\nThe measure explicitly aims to neuter SB1070, a 2010 Arizona immigration law that drew mass protests and a boycott of Arizona. SB1070 prohibits sanctuary cities in Arizona and requires police to verify the immigration status of anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant. Courts threw out much of the law but upheld the requirement for officers to check immigration papers. \\nCALIFORNIA SHERIFF BLASTS â??FOLKS IN SACRAMENTOâ?? AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ALLEGEDLY SHOOTS DEPUTY, SPARKS CHASE\\nTucson's mayor and city council members â?? all Democrats â?? oppose Proposition 205Â because they're concerned the city could lose millions of federal and state funds, which make up a chunk of the Tucson's budget. They say police have already adopted rules that go as far as legally possible to restrict officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \\nA handful of Republican state lawmakers have said they will pursue legislation to punish Tucson. Prior legislation approved by the GOP Legislature to tie the hands of liberal cities allows the state to cut off funding for cities that pass laws conflicting with state laws.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n   \n",

Kamala Harris of California.\\nSteyerâ??s campaign confirmed on Monday evening that Dwane Sims, the billionaire candidateâ??s deputy South Carolina state director, offered his resignation following an internal investigation into the allegationsÂ that he stole the data of thousands of contacts from the Harris campaign. \\nâ??Last week, the South Carolina Democratic Party turned off voter file access to the Steyer campaign for a short period of time. When it was reinstated, Dwane Sims, a former South Carolina Democratic Party employee, had access to other presidential campaign data,â? Heather Hargreaves, Steyerâ??s campaign manager, said in a statement. â??When we first learned about the matter, we conducted an internal investigation and wiped Mr. Simsâ?? computer to make sure the data was completely deleted and that there was no access to other campaign data.â?\\nDAVID AVELLA: TOM STEYER IS BIDEN'S BIGGEST THREAT\\nShe added: â??We understand the sensitivity and importance of this information. We apologize to the South Carolina Democratic Party and the DNC. Tom Steyer and the Steyer campaign extend our deepest apology to Senator Kamala Harris and her campaign.â?\\nThe Steyer campaign noted that the South Carolina Democratic Party had turned off access for a short time last week to voter files and when it was reinstated Sims â?? as a former employee of the state party â?? had access to information on other presidential candidates' data. Sims called the SCDP â??[w]ithin minutes of realizing thisâ? and access was disabled, according to Steyerâ??s campaign.\\nBut inÂ a story first reported by The Post and Courier of Charleston, officials from the SCDP and the Democratic National Committee said they actually intervened in Sims' attempt to export the data, which included thousands of voter contacts built up by Harris' campaign.\\n\"Our organizers and volunteers work incredibly hard, and as this story notes, our campaign â??has built a particularly extensive field organizing operation in South Carolina,â??â? Ian Sams, the Harris campaignâ??s national press secretary, said in a tweet. â??It's unfortunate anyone would try to steal that work from our team.\"\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nSims was announced last month as Steyer's deputy state director in South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South. A month earlier, Sims had been working as data director for the South Carolina Democratic Party, a role in which he had access to proprietary campaign information.\\nA recent poll by The Post and Courier has Steyer polling at 5 percent, compared with Harris at 11 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden still holds a commanding lead in Palmetto State with 30 percent. \\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n   \n",

Aaron Barta, commander of the Corpsâ?? Los Angeles District, said in a statement. â??This is a storm that is unlikely to occur, but it is nonetheless a real possibility and one we must be prepared for.\"\\nCALIFORNIA POLICE RIP DRONE PILOT AS DEVICE GETS IN WAY OF WILDFIRE RELIEF EFFORTS\\nThe earthen dam was built in 1971 near the San Bernardino Mountains, and was \"designed and constructed consistent with the standards of the day,\" according to federal officials.\\n\\n      The Mojave River Dam, pictured in this undated photo, was built in the 1970s near the San Bernardino Mountains. Officials said Friday the dam could fail during an extreme storm, causing flooding in Mojave Desert communities.\\n      (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)\\n\"It continues to operate as it was designed and reduces risk for more than 16,000 people and $1.5 billion in property,\" the agency said.\\nThe 200-foot dam has never been breached, but an assessment done in 2018 found that during an extreme storm, water could flow over the top of the structure, causing it to erode and potentially fail.Â If the dam were to fail, it would threaten the communities of Hesperia, Apple Valley, Victorville and Barstow, located adjacent to the Mojave River that is home to about 300,000 people.\\nA potential dam failure could generate flooding that could even impact the town of Baker, located more than 140 miles downriver.\\nLuciano Vera, a spokesman for the Los Angeles district of the Army Corps of Engineers, told the Associated Press that the chances of a storm that could overtop the dam are small, about 1-in-10,000.\\nBut Vera added just because chances are small doesn't minimalize the threat.\\nInsight from Mark Ogden, project manager for the Association of State Dam Safety Officials\\n\"All it takes is one event...one Katrina, one Hurricane Harvey,â? Vera told the AP. â??These storms are happening more and more, so this is our way of looking toward the future.â?\\nCALIFORNIA GOVERNOR PLEADS WITH RESIDENTS TO STOP TARGETING UTILITY WORKERS\\nThe Army Corps said in a news release it is evaluating interim risk-reduction measures associated with a potential overtopping of the dam and anticipates that some of those measures will be in place ahead of this year's winter rains.Â The Army Corps has been looking at all of its 700 dams nationwide in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devastation in 2005.\\nThe Army Corp's LA District owns and operates 17 dams across California, Arizona and Nevada that reduce the risk of flooding for about 7 million people and $200 billion in the property. Those dams are \"reviewed periodically\" and rated according to the age and condition of the dam, in addition to potential consequences. The federal agency's dams range from low to \"very high urgency of action.\"\\nIn the wake of Friday's announcement, the Corps also said that it is \"actively coordinating\" with partners and coordinating public outreach as part of interim risk-management strategies.\\n\"We're working closely with San Bernardino County, Apple Valley, Victorville, Hesperia and other downstream agencies to improve flood-risk awareness and emergency preparedness,\" said Kristen Bedolla, Dam Safety Program manager for the LA District. \"Community preparation also is a key component in reducing flood risk.â?\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nClaudia Cowan reports from Oroville\\nIn May, the Corps upgraded the risk characterization of Prado Dam to high urgency. That dam is located on the Santa Ana River in the Los Angeles suburb of Corona. Dozens of Southern California cities with about 1.4 million people live downstream. Work to improve the dam has been underway since 2002 to increase the amount of floodwaters and sediment it can store.\\nIn 2017, some 200,000 people in three Sierra Nevada counties in Northern CaliforniaÂ were forced to evacuate after spillways at the Oroville Dam crumbled and fell away during heavy rains.\\nFlooding didnâ??t happen, however, and the dam and associated spillways have since been repaired.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n   \n",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\\nA 15-year-old boy appeared in court Saturday on attempted murder charges for allegedly shooting a 7-year-old girl while she was out trick-or-treating.\\nChicago police identified the suspect in the Halloween shooting of the girl, who was dressed a bumblebee andÂ out collecting candy, and a 32-year-old man. The girl was shot in the right side of her neck andÂ upper chest and remains in critical condition, and the man was shot in his left hand.\\nPolice said the man and the girl were not together and have no relationship. They said the man shot was not the intended target, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\\nThe teen, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, faces two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery through discharge of a firearm, according to a Friday release by Chicago police. Judge Joanne Rosado also told him he is charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, according to the Chicago Tribune.Â Heâ??ll be held in detention at least until a second hearing on Monday.\\nCALIFORNIA HALLOWEEN PARTY SHOOTING LEAVES AT LEAST 4 DEAD\\nThe shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. when threeÂ people walked up to another group of people in an alley in Chicagoâ??s Little Village neighborhood on the southwest side. Assistant stateâ??s attorney Jack Ruggiero told the court the boy and several others, at least one of whom was wearing a mask, went out that day â??looking for troubleâ? and looking for a Latin King (member of a Hispanic Chicago street gang). The shooting occurred close to the border dividing rival street gangs.\\nWhen they spotted the 32-year-old man on the otherÂ side of the alley as the little girl, one of them first tried to shake his hand. They informed him they were Gangster Two-Six members and then chased him, yelling â??Two-six!â? and â??King Killa!â? before the suspect fired seven times, hitting the man and the child.\\nAfter the shooting, the boy fled down another alley. The group listened to a police scanner and learned the little girl was shot. According to Ruggiero, the boy â??urinated on his handsâ? after learning about the girl to try to get the gunpowder off his hands. The boy told members of his group to â??hide the jacketâ? he was wearing.\\nRuggiero said police found the gun used in the attack after witnesses heard the boy say he tossed the gun in an alley near garbage cans and a school before he ran away. Video surveillance recorded him hiding the gun there.\\nThe suspect was arrested around 1:30 a.m. Friday.\\nâ??He transformed (the street) into a real-life horror movie,â? Ruggiero said. â??He showed complete disregard for human life,â? when he fired a gun seven times, Ruggiero added.\\nEVIDENCE IN MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER IS INSURMOUNTABLE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAYS\\n\"This minor didnâ??t care about the 7-year-old girl,'' Ruggiero said. He \"involved himself'' in a gang conflict.\\nThe boyâ??s defense attorney John Miraglia said in court the boy â??absolutelyâ? denies the charges. He said the boy has no â??publishableâ? background and said his parents are â??good people.â? His mother and stepfather appeared in court but gave no comment.\\nThe boyÂ spoke quietly during the hearing, mostly giving the judge yes or no answers. As Judge Rosado read the charges, he said â??I have a question,â? but the judge did not allow him to elaborate. The boy twisted around to look at his mother, who nodded several times at him as he was taken back into custody.\\nFamily members of the girl who was shot prayed outside Stroger hospital, where she was being cared for, Thursday night.Â â??The family of the 7-year-old girl who was shot in Little Village is grateful for the outpouring of love and support shown by all of Chicago and the nation. She remains in serious condition. At this time, the family is requesting privacy,â? a Cook County health department statement said.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nLocal resident Jose Vazquez told the Sun-Times the sceneÂ of the attack has been a hotbed for violence. \"That alley is crazy,â? he said.\\n   \n",

Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro is laying off his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two of the first four early-voting states in the primary and caucus nominating season.\\nThe former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing secretary in then-President Barack Obamaâ??s cabinet will now focus his campaign on Iowa, which kicks off the nominating calendar, and Nevada, which votes third. The news â?? first reported by Politico â?? was confirmed early Tuesday by Fox News with a source close to the Castro campaign. The small staffs in both New Hampshire and South Carolina were notified on Monday.\\nCASTRO REACHES FUNDRAISING GOAL, STAYING IN 2020 RACE\\nThe move by the Castro campaign comes just a few days after it announced on Friday that it brought in $800,000 in the last 10 days of October, a haul Castro had said was necessary to continue his uphill bid for the Democratic nomination.\\nBut reaching that goal didnâ??t erase the steep fundraising hurdles facing the campaign. Castro, who launched his longshot bid last December, has frequently spotlighted his underdog status as he runs for the nomination against many much better-known and better-funded rivals.\\nCastro made the stage for the first four rounds of Democratic presidential primary debates, but has yet to qualify for the fifth round, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia. The candidate has reached the individual donor threshold but remains short of reaching the polling criteria.\\nIn a fundraising email on Monday, CastroÂ campaign officials warned that their candidate was in jeopardy of not making the debate stage and said that they were â??launching IMMEDIATE digital adsâ? to help them clinch â??the final polls Julian needs to qualify.â?\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\nCastro, the only Latino among the major Democratic White House hopefuls, will now pour his remaining resources into Iowa â?? where he launches a five-figure ad buy on Tuesday â?? and Nevada. Heâ??ll also concentrate on his native Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, directly after the early voting states. The other Texan in the nomination race,Â former Rep. Beto Oâ??Rourke,Â ended his White House bid on Friday. \\nCastro raised roughly $3.5 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, but spent nearly $4 million in the same period. Castro has just $670,000 cash on hand at the start of October, but raised $1 million last month.\\n\\n      Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro signs the famed wooden eggs as he headlines 'Politics and Eggs' at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, NH in January, 2019\\n      \\nEyebrows were raised in New Hampshire in recent days as Castroâ??s campaign had yet to schedule a date for their candidate to file in person to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. The source close to the campaign said it was unclear if Castro would file in person.\\nKAMALA HARRIS LAYS OFF STAFF, SHUTS OFFICES, IN NH\\nThe move by Castro follows a similar step made last week by Sen. Kamala Harris. The California Democrat, hemorrhaging campaign cash, dramatically cut her staff in New Hampshire and closed all of her field offices in the first primary state, as she continues to concentrate all of her resources on Iowa.\\n   \n",

The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky toÂ investigateÂ former Vice President Joe Biden and hisÂ son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\\nA transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\\nIn the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced â??evidence,â? such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaneyâ??s role in Trumpâ??s conversations with Zelensky.\\nâ??â?¦Bolton told a National Security Council staffer â??to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaneyâ?? Â to pressure Ukraine for political help,â? they wrote.\\nâ??Ambassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the Presidentâ??s scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, â??I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,â??â? they wrote. â??The â??drug dealâ?? appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.â?\\nThe chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing â??a central roleâ? in the presidentâ??s move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.\\nâ??You admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the Presidentâ??s own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,â? they wrote.\\nDuring a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White Houseâ??s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\\nâ??We do that all the time with foreign policy,â? Mulvaney said. â??And I have news for everybody: Get over it. Thereâ??s going to be political influence in foreign policy.â?\\nMulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.\\nâ??Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trumpâ??s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the Presidentâ??s 2020 re-election campaign,â? they wrote.\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\\nFox News' Chad Pergram and John Roberts contributed to this report.Â \\n   \n",

With several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees could soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench.\\nPresident Trump is on his way to reaching a significant mark in his presidency, asÂ his latest nominees for federal appeals courtsÂ go through the confirmation process.\\nWith several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees couldÂ soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench. Out of 179 Circuit Court positions, 43 are occupied by Trump picks, with four current vacancies and another five spots opening up due to upcoming retirements.\\nTRUMP JUDICIAL PICK BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AT HEARING OVER LEGAL GROUPâ??S ATTACK\\nâ??This is an exciting milestone for the president,â? Judicial Crisis Network policy director Carrie Severino told Fox News.\\nWhile a number of Trumpâ??s picks are filling seats previously held by judges appointed by Republican presidents, many are taking the place of liberal jurists appointed by Democrats. The Ninth Circuit, for example, once known as a staunchly liberal Court of Appeals, is gradually evening out. Trump has already placed six judges on the Ninth Circuit bench, which currently has one vacancy and will have two more in the near future.\\nShould Trump fill all three spots, he will have chosen nearly a third of the roster with nine out of 29 judges.\\nSeverino described Trumpâ??s appellate nominees as â??exceptional,â? while stressing their independence.\\nâ??Thatâ??s the kind of judge America wants,â? Severino said, claiming that the ability to select judges for lifetime positions is a significant part of why Trump was elected in 2016.\\nTRUMP NOMINATES WAVE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES, IN FRESH BID TO RESHAPE COURTS\\nDemocrats have been fierce in their opposition to several of Trumpâ??s selections. Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counselâ??s office.Â A segment on Rachel Maddowâ??s MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled \"Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy.\"Â Maddow cited Menashiâ??s use of the term â??ethnonationalismâ? to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on theÂ â??fringe of racial thinking.â?\\nDuring questioning, Sen.Â Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that MenashiÂ had faced â??unusually personalâ? and â??viciousâ? attacks.\\nMenashi denied the allegations, saying, â??Itâ??s hurtful and I think it misrepresents what Iâ??ve written.â?\\nDuring his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on â??constitutional traditions.\"\\nMenashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.\\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as â??Well Qualified,â? its highest mark.\\nThe ABAâ??s rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a â??Not Qualifiedâ? rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\\nThe ABAâ??s letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigantsÂ and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had runÂ against VanDyke for a judicial position.\\nAdditionally, multiple people who were interviewed by the ABA for VanDykeâ??s evaluation told Fox News that they gave positive reviews and were surprised by the ABAâ??s findings.\\nAddressing the accusations in the ABAâ??s letter, specifically his supposed stance towards the LGBTQ community, VanDyke broke down in tears in the middle of his hearing, denying the allegation.\\nâ??No, I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God. They should all be treated with dignity and respect,â? he said.\\nDespite opposition from the left, Trumpâ??s picks are likely to be confirmed due to the Senateâ??s Republican majority. \\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nMike Davis, president of The Article III Project, which works to help secure the confirmation of Trumpâ??s picks, noted that the presidentâ??s success in this area fulfills one of his 2016 campaign promises.\\nâ??President Trump has delivered on his promise to American voters,â? Davis said, pointing to Trumpâ??s appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, â??and an all-time-record number of circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals.â?\\n   \n",

Dr. Vin Gupta weighs in.\\nAs \"Medicare-for-all\" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary,Â a new report released by the British government on itsÂ National Health Service, or NHS,Â offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.\\nThe reportÂ on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, detailsÂ increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visitsÂ to cancer care.Â And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.\\n\"Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,\" the report also declares.\\nAn American \"Medicare-for-all\" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system.Â Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.\\nBut the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range ofÂ Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth WarrenÂ haveÂ captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.\\nCritics in the United States have saidÂ that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.\\n\"Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'\" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday.Â \"Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.'Â But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?\\n\"Thereâ??s a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren wonâ??t admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.\"\\nThe reportÂ on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standardsÂ in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.\\n\"In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,\" the report says of cancer wait times. \"During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded.

OneÂ child is currently missing, and authorities are searching the mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border for the child.\\nThose attacked were members of the LeBaron family, a well-known American clan who hasÂ lived in the community in the northern part of the country for decades, according toÂ The New York Times.Â The attack targeted citizens who live in a community founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\n\"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,\" Trump tweeted. \"We merely await a call from your great new president!\"\\nPresident AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador refused that approach, however, saying at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\"\\n\"We declared war, and it didn't work,\" Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. \"That is not an option.\"\\nTrump has repeatedly raised concerns about levels of gang violence and drug-related crime in Mexico, particularly as it relates to securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The two countries have stepped up cooperation on that front over the summer, with asylum seekers being returned to Mexico to await hearings, while Mexico has also increased its troop presence on both its northern and southern borders.\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nEarly reports indicated the tragedy could have been a case of mistaken identity, but recent history also raises the possibility the LeBaron family was the intended target: only a decade ago, two members of the family opposed to local drug trafficking groups were kidnapped and murdered, according to the New York Times.\\nMexico's federal Department of Security and Citizens' Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area following \"the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people.\" The troops were searching for the missing community members, believed to include 11 children or more.\\nA number of Republicans backed Trump's call for action in Mexico in response to the massacre. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said that Mexico is \"dangerously closeÂ to being a failed state.\"\\n\"This is what happens when Mexicoâ??s politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power. Enough. Mexicoâ??s president hasnâ??t taken the threat seriously and innocent American lives have been lost again. The Mexican government must partner with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to wage a full-scale offensive against these butchers,â? he said.\\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose own father was born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, also extended his condolences for the victims and called for the U.S. to get involved.\\nâ??Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence,â? he tweeted.\\nFox Newsâ??

Under the sentence, Olsen is prohibited from working in law enforcement, possessing firearms or profiting from the case. \\nDear Jackson praised what she said was the strength, fortitude and compassion of the family of the victim, 26-year-old Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. She said she had also watched the defendant closely during the trial. \\n\"Many might have thought you were stoic and void of emotion,\" the judge told Olsen. \"From the time opening statements started, I saw the tears that you've had. I saw how you replayed March 9, 2015, in your head.\" \\nProsecutors had asked the court for a 25-year sentence with five years probation. \\nA jury last month acquitted Olsen of murder in the March 2015 death of Hill but found him guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath.\\nJurors deliberated for more than a week. Olsen had faced up to 35 years in prison.\\nBefore sentencing, the court heard from Hill's mother, father and sister.\\n\"The decision Robert Olsen made that day changed my life forever,\" said his mother, Carolyn Baylor Giummo. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\\nShe remembered her son as a compassionate child, a talented choir singer and student-athlete whose life seemed to change after his deployment to Afghanistan.   \\n\"He didn't come back unscathed,\" she said. At the time of the shooting, Hill had had stopped taking his medications because of side effects and suffered a breakdown, she said. \\nGiummo recalled her father always telling her and his grandchildren that \"if you're ever in trouble, run to the police.\"\\n\"The jury may have found Mr. Robert Olsen not guilty of murder but he still killed my son,\" she told the court. \"He has never taken responsibility for taking my son's life. He's never just said, 'I'm sorry for killing Tony.'\"\\n Anthony Hill, Sr., said he felt as if he had failed as a father for not protecting his son. He lamented that the defendant never once looked him in the eye with an expression of remorse. \\n\"I stood out in that passageway many a day just hoping to make a little bit of eye contact,\" he said. \"Not one time would he look my way.\"\\nOlsen's wife, Catherine, read a statement in court. She said one of the few times she saw her husband break down emotionally was after he killed Hill. \\n\"He was mourning for the individual whose life he had taken,\" she said, adding that she and Olsen recognize the pain of Hill's family. \\n\"I cannot imagine how hard this had been for his parents and family,\" she said.  \\nCatherine Olsen was overcome by emotion as her husband was taken away by officers after the sentencing.\\nOlsen did not address the court.\\nBefore the shooting, someone in Hill's neighborhood called police to report a man was \"acting deranged, knocking on doors, and crawling around on the ground naked,\" then-DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said then.\\nOlsen was dispatched, and \"when (Hill) saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer. The officer called him to stop while stepping backwards, drew his weapon and fired two shots,\" Alexander said.\\nDefense attorney Amanda Clark Palmer said Olsen, who worked for the DeKalb County police, was \"a good cop who had to make a tough decision.\"\\nHill's girlfriend previously said he had a history of mental illness and struggled to get the support he needed from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had stopped taking his medication shortly before his death, she said. \\nDuring closing arguments, the prosecution claimed Olsen did not follow protocol for using force. Assistant District Attorney Lance Cross said Olsen could have used a baton on Hill.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)The winner of Mississippi's gubernatorial election Tuesday will not only have to capture the state's popular vote, but will also have to prevail in the state's unique election process for electing a governor and other statewide officials that was established during the Jim Crow era. \\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state's popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as \"leans Republican\" -- the state's unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. \\nA candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nThe election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \\nCritics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\\nThe provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\\nWhile Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)Mary Kerrie Davis had smoked cigarettes for most of her adult life, when she embraced vaping as a way to quit.\\nFor several years, the 52-year-old mother from Georgia vaped only nicotine. But after trying THC cartridges, she began to experience health problems. On September 6, she died.\\nMary Kerrie's case sounds like the nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related injury confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of this week, the outbreak has led to 37 vaping-related deaths in 24 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands.\\nMany of those cases and deaths were among people who vaped THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.\\n\"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters in October. \"But I'd like to stress that we don't know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or way that the devices are producing harm.\"\\nMary Kerrie's death hasn't yet been counted in the CDC's total. Her grieving family has many questions still without answers. But they believe that vaping THC is what ultimately led to her death.\\nFrom smoking to vaping\\nWhen Mary Kerrie transitioned to vaping nicotine a few years ago, she stopped smoking cigarettes completely, her daughter, Maggie Davis, said. Mary Kerrie was adamant with family and friends that vaping was healthier than smoking.\\n\"She thought it was safer,\" her husband, Kevin Davis, said. \"I certainly liked the fact that there wasn't the cigarette smell and her breath didn't smell like cigarettes. I kind of thought it was better, too.\"\\nMaggie remembers that her mom came to California this summer to help her move into her dorm for her senior year of college. While there, Mary Kerrie went to a vape shop and purchased THC cartridges for the first time.\\nImmediately upon returning home, she developed a nagging cough. Kevin didn't know Mary Kerrie had been vaping THC cartridges. Only after her death did the Davis family learn that Mary Kerrie had continued buying and using THC cartridges in Georgia. Unlike in California, THC is illegal in the Davis' home state.\\n'I hope you don't have that vaping disease'\\nMary Kerrie experienced a steady decline in health between the time she started vaping THC cartridges and her death. The initial health effects she had experienced from vaping to quit smoking transitioned into frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a terrible cough. They're all among the reported symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\nMary Kerrie went to the hospital for assessment on September 4. A flu swab tested negative. She texted her daughter that she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nMaggie had just begun hearing reports of a national outbreak of a mystery illness related to vaping. She texted her mom, \"I hope you don't have that vaping disease.\"\\nOn the way home from the hospital, groaning between coughs, Mary Kerrie said, \"I'm never smoking again. I'm throwing out all of my e-cigarettes and weed pens,\" Maggie wrote in a personal essay for her college newspaper.\\nKevin, an OB/GYN, encouraged Mary Kerrie when she declared she was quitting it all.\\nStill, Mary Kerrie's symptoms became worse over the next two days. She stayed home from social gatherings, telling her husband that she just needed rest.\\nHe felt she should be seen again by a doctor.\\nDays later, on September 6, Mary Kerrie was still sick. It was Kevin who found her, lips blue and gasping for breath, whispering, \"help.\"\\nOn the way to the hospital again, Mary Kerrie's pulse was barely detectable. She'd become unresponsive.\\nAt the hospital, doctors performed CPR unsuccessfully.\\nMoments later, Mary Kerrie -- an outgoing 52-year-old who loved rollerskating and mountain biking, a mother and wife who was known for being vivacious and happy -- was gone.\\n\"She will never see her youngest daughter graduate high school, nor her oldest graduate college,\" Maggie wrote after her death. \"She will never see her daughters married or meet her grandchildren. Her absence, a sudden and jarring hole in my family, will be felt for decades to come.\"\\nIn X-rays on the day Mary Kerrie presented at the hospital, her lungs had looked clear. Two days later, they revealed a white substance resembling clouds infiltrating Mary Kerrie's lungs.\\n'From healthy to drowning in your own lungs'\\nTo the Davis family, the X-rays seemed to confirm what they had heard in the news: Mary Kerrie's illness wasn't simply a case of pneumonia. In addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain, the whiteout in her lungs was one of the symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\n\"This wasn't a nursing home patient. This wasn't somebody with a chronic illness,\" Kevin said. \"You don't just go from healthy to drowning in your own lungs and a flatline EKG from things in your daily life.\"\\nNearly two months after Mary Kerrie's death, her case is still not part of the official CDC count of vaping-related lung injury deaths.\\nIn part, it speaks to just how new of a phenomenon this is. The ongoing investigation \"may take a few months\" and could yield \"multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\" CDC's Schuchat told reporters early in October.\\nFor the Davis family, the wait has been frustrating. To them, it seems obvious that Mary Kerrie's death is related to vaping.\\nKevin said he recently spoke with a CDC official who said that his wife's case met the agency's definition of a vaping-related illness, but the agency is waiting for the county medical examiner's decision before making an announcement.\\nThere have already been three confirmed vaping-related deaths in Georgia. If and when it is announced, Mary Kerrie's death could be the fourth, potentially making Georgia's death count the highest in the United States.\\nMary Kerrie's legacy\\nThe Davis family and Mary Kerrie's friends want her to be remembered for the good she brought into their lives.\\n\"She was all in on me and all in on our daughters, all in on her family. Anything that she wanted to be a part of, it was everything for her,\" Kevin said of their 24-year marriage. \"Her energy is beautiful, and I sure miss her.\"\\nThe Davis family attributes part of the blame for Mary Kerrie's death to a lack of regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration.\\n\"Marijuana pens also boast exponentially higher numbers of THC, and yet we still do not know how this historically disproportionate consumption of marijuana affects the human body, particularly when consumed as an oil,\" Maggie wrote.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA warned consumers to stop using THC vaping products as investigations into vaping-related lung injuries and deaths continue. Last week, the CDC made a similar warning, saying \"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC.\"\\n\"Mary Kerrie vaped [nicotine] products for several years I would say, successfully, and did quit smoking,\" Kevin said. \"I think when she was exposed to legal THC in California and then got illicit THC in Georgia ... I think that's what killed her.\"\\n\"Other people, if they're being exposed to something that can kill them, I hope they stop,\" Kevin said. \"I hope her passing helps somebody else.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York  (CNN Business)Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash pile keeps expanding, but Warren Buffett's industrial and insurance conglomerate has yet to make a major acquisition to ramp up growth.\\nBerkshire on Saturday reported it has $128 billion in cash, up from $122 billion in the second quarter.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has lagged the market this year, and Buffett has said that he wants to make an \"elephant\" sized acquisition with the company's mountain of cash. The problem is that the market rally has made any potential targets much more expensive, and Buffett has said he doesn't want to overspend on deals.\\nBerkshire's operating profit rose to $7.9 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year earlier, boosted by gains across its holdings. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's performance is tied to its many subsidiaries -- which include GEICO, railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe and consumer brands like Duracell, Dairy Queen and paint maker Benjamin Moore -- as well as a massive investment portfolio.\\nBerkshire also said tariffs from the US-China trade war weighed on its consumer and industrial businesses. The tariffs cut into sales of Precision Castparts, it gas turbine and pipe products unit, the filings said. BNSF railroad saw a 5% profit gain due to cost-cutting measures to offset a drag from trade tensions.\\nWhile Berkshire has yet to make a major acquisition, the company has been taking steps to embrace more reasonably valued tech stocks in recent years. Berkshire Hathaway still owns large stakes in value stalwarts like Coke, (KO) Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX) and Kraft Heinz, (KHC) which has taken billions of dollars in writedowns this year on some of its top brands.\\nBut the company's biggest holding now is Apple (AAPL), and Berkshire even has a small stake in Amazon (AMZN).\\nBerkshire Hathaway also purchased $700 million of its own stock in the third quarter, an uptick from the $442 million it bought last quarter. The company purchased $1.7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter.\\nPreviously, the company did not allow stock buybacks. The board changed a rule last year to allow the company to begin purchasing back billions of dollars worth of stock, a practice that has been criticized by some analysts as inflating share prices.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)McDonald's Happy Meal might be for kids, but officially it's over the hill. \\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of the company's first Happy Meal, the kids meal that helped McDonald's achieve fast food supremacy. Today, roughly one in every four orders at McDonald's includes a Happy Meal, according to retail data tracker Sense360. \\nEach Happy Meal contains the option of a hamburger or chicken nuggets, a side like french fries and a drink. And a toy, some of which have become collector's items. \\nMcDonald's is celebrating this milestone by re-releasing some of its most popular toys over the past four decades, including Ty Beanie Babies' Patti the Platypus and the Tamagotchi. Between November 7 through 11, McDonald's (MCD) will sell a \"Surprise Happy Meal\" in 90 countries that will include the throwback toys.\\nIt's the latest quick-service restaurant to tap into nostalgia to excite customers. Since fast-food customers are not particularly loyal to any brand,  fast-food companies must resort to marketing tactics or wacky food creations to draw in customers.\\nHere's a brief history of the Happy Meal:\\n1979\\nThe Circus Wagon Happy Meal, as it was originally known, launched in the United States in June 1979. The meal included a hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and cookies. Some of the early Happy Meal toys included a McDoodler stencil, McWrist wallet and a spinning top. The box became instantly recognizable with the meal. \\n1982\\nAfter becoming a hit in the United States, McDonald's expanded the meal internationally. It debuted first in Latin America before hitting Australia and New Zealand. \\n1984\\nMcDonald's added McNuggets as a Happy Meal option. The addition inspired a line of Happy Meal toys modeled after the McNuggets.\\n1991\\nMcDonald's partnered with United Airlines (UAL) to offer Happy Meals on some of its flights. The deal ended in 2001.\\n1998\\nThe first-ever global Happy Meal debuted with Disney film \"Mulan.\" The meal had identical packaging and toys across 40 countries.\\n2012 - 2013\\nAs its customers shifted toward healthier eating habits, McDonald's began overhauling the Happy Meal. In 2012, McDonald's made the french fries portion smaller, and it added fruit as an option. In 2013, it added milk or juice as beverage choices.\\n2018\\nMcDonald's said it would provide cheeseburgers in Happy Meals only upon request. It removed artificial preservatives from some of its entrees and added bottled water as a drink option. The company said that 3.4 billion fruit, low-fat dairy and water items have been served in Happy Meals in the US since 2013.\\n2020\\nStarting next year, McDonald's will add a new reduced-sugar and low-fat chocolate milk option. It has 25% less sugar compared to the previous version.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)Toys \"R\" Us is returning to select malls in major metropolitan areas this holiday season with what it hopes is an innovative retail plan that could upend how stores sell toys.\\nIt comes two years after the company filed for bankruptcy and shuttered all its locations - seemingly for good - and just after toymaker Hasbro (HAS) reported disappointing third quarter sales heading into the industry's most crucial sales season. Hasbro's chief rival, Mattel (MAT), enjoyed a sales surge of 3% over the same period. Both toy companies' success was largely tied to Toys \"R\" Us prior to the retailer's financial demise and rebirth.\\nThe revamped Toys \"R\" Us will open two streamlined locations ahead of Black Friday in Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and The Galleria in Houston.\\n\"We know that customers love shopping as a means of entertainment. That's something built into the DNA of human beings,\" Richard Barry, president and CEO of Toys \"R\" Us parent company, Tru Kids, told CNN Business. \"We also know kids and families are looking for things to do on the weekends or when school's out. We know parents and families really value play and the value of toys overall. As we thought about the strategy, we wanted to put all those things together.\"\\nThese are not simply stores, according to the company. The store chain will partner with the retail service startup B8ta to create hands-on, engaging experiences for kids and their parents, who may have fond memories of Toys \"R\" Us from their own childhoods.\\nThe old Toys \"R\" Us stores were 40,000-square-foot behemoths with merchandise stacked on endless rows of metal shelves. The new stores are about 6,500 square feet, with interactive spaces where kids and parents can play with toys.\\nThe revalitized Toys \"R\" Us website also showcases fewer toys, but gives more details on them. Those looking to purchase items are redirected to Target's (TGT) website, which provides inventory and fulfillment services.\\nB8ta, which designs interactive stores displays where shoppers can try the latest products, will bring theaters, video games, and other engaging items to the new Toys \"R\" Us stores.\\n\"We've got a huge treehouse in the middle of the store that kids will be able to climb into, an event space for movies in the store. We'll have great brands in the store,\" Barry said.\\nJohn Goodman, CEO of Candytopia, helped implement this \"shop-o-tainment\" idea two years ago before partnering with Toys \"R\" Us earlier this year to launch \"Toys R Us Adventure,\" a touring indoor play space appearing in select malls across the country for a limited time. The ticketed attraction costs $20 for children ages 4-12 and $28 for adults. It features toy-themed play areas for small children who, the company hopes, will bug their parents to buy them merchandise associated with the fun zones they've just finished exploring. \\nThese pop-up playlands aren't permanent stores. After about six months they will set up shop somewhere else.\\nGoodman, who previously served as CEO of The Gap (GPS), Kmart, and Sears, used a similar blueprint to help Candytopia founder Jackie Sorkin turn her birthday party and event business into a multi-million dollar, confection-themed touring attraction celebrated by celebrity influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore.\\nToys \"R\" Adventure's first run in Chicago and Atlanta generated national headlines last week as families celebrated the return of the familiar retail brand.  Pictures and videos of smiling, laughing children walking through imitation snow caves and interacting with the Toys \"R\" Us mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, are circulating now on Instagram and Facebook.\\nThe Toys \"R\" Us Adventure in Atlanta's Lenox Marketplace shopping complex was nearly filled to capacity, Goodman said. \\n\"We feel like we're adding a service to the mall in terms of driving additional traffic, anything from 1,700 to 2,200 people every single day,\" Goodman told CNN Business. \"It's like the circus. The circus comes to town and the circus leaves. It may or may not be back in a couple of years. That's how our model is built.\"\\nThis idea isn't exactly new, but it is catching on elsewhere. The minds behind New Jersey's new American Dream mall, which opened on Friday, came up with a similar concept. The Rutherford, New Jersey shopping complex is less a place to buy consumer goods and more of an indoor theme park with cartoon-themed attractions in its Nickelodeon Universe. It also has an indoor ski slope, a water park, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink.\\nScott Webb, CEO of the digital consulting firm Avionos, says this may be the future of toy-related, brick-and-mortar retail shopping. Encouraging kids to play with toys that aren't tied to TV, movie, or video game characters is crucial for the industry, which has struggled in an era when children binge watching shows on streaming services often avoid commercials advertising toys that they won't see on their favorite shows.\\n\"Kids as much as anything are digital consumers now,\" Webb told CNN Business. \"The Hasbro numbers back this up. The segments of toys that have really thrived are those tied to some intellectual property, whether it's Fortnite or Marvel or Star Wars.\" \\nWebb said Toys \"R\" Us turning its company into a toy discovery brand as opposed to a retailer may be a good strategy. \"I think they absolutely have a lot of brand equity to carve out a new niche in that role,\" he continued. \"But I think it would be hard to predict them ever discovering the same dominance in retail.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Busines)America's top supermarkets are facing a new challenge: Grocery aisles in stores aren't suited to meet the growing demand for online orders.\\nSo Walmart, Albertsons, Stop &amp; Shop, Meijer, Hy-Vee and others are building automated mini-warehouses inside their stores and opening up \"dark stores\" — locations that look like supermarkets but are closed to customers — to make deliveries and prepare pickup orders.\\nAlthough only around 5% of US shoppers buy their groceries online today, analysts expect that number to rise in the coming years.\\nWalmart has trained more than 30,000 workers to fulfill customers' online grocery orders, but in some cases that has led to congested aisles with workers in its own stores during peak shopping times, such as weekends.\\nWalmart US chief Greg Foran earlier this year said an executive complained to him, \"'I hate shopping in the store on Sunday trying to get up and down the aisles.'\"\\nFor grocers that partner with third-party services, often \"there are as many people selecting for Instacart as there are customers,\" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail and grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.\\nGrocery store margins are tight. And workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is expensive for grocers. That's why grocers are looking to technology to reduce costs and keep aisles from jamming up.\\n'Micro-fulfillment centers' \\nAlbertsons and Stop &amp; Shop are testing automated \"micro-fulfillment centers\" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.\\nStop &amp; Shop, owned by Dutch parent Ahold Delhaize, is building a 12,000-square-foot fully automated fulfillment center in the backroom of a store in Windsor, Connecticut, for deliveries in the Hartford area. Stop &amp; Shop offers delivery through its online Peapod service.\\nMeijer announced this month that it will also begin testing micro-fulfillment with a logistics company to \"maximize space in our stores\" and expand online options, said Sid Handa, the company's director of strategic supply chain initiatives.\\nAnd in Salem, New Hampshire, Walmart is piloting a system with autonomous carts that gather customers' grocery orders and bring them to Walmart workers, who then prepare them for delivery or pickup.\\nSome analysts say these models are an advantage over large, centralized warehouses, which are often located further away from customers than stores. That's why micro-fulfillment centers can save grocers in delivery costs, according to experts.\\n\"Micro-fulfillment helps retailers solve the labor and last-mile costs conundrum,\" Christopher Mandeville, analyst at Jefferies, said in a research report earlier this month. \\nMandeville estimates that the cost of delivering groceries from central warehouses is usually around two times higher than using micro-fulfillment in stores. Jefferies cut Kroger's stock earlier this month in part because the company has invested in centralized facilities through a deal with Ocado, instead of micro-fulfillment.\\nGrocers are also moving the picking process out of stores entirely and testing so-called dark stores. Some dark stores have automation, while others are still manned by employees to do all of the picking of goods purchased online, said Mandeville.\\n\"Dark stores in grocery are an emerging trend,\" said Michael Demko, founder of grocery consulting firm Locai Solutions.\\nWalmart recently opened Walmart Pickup Point, a 40,000-square-foot prototype outside of Chicago at a former Dominick's grocery store. Customers drive up to the site to designated parking spots, and a Walmart worker loads up their trunk with their order. Walmart can also make deliveries from the location. \\nThe inside of the location looks like a Walmart with groceries and everyday items. Unlike a traditional Walmart supercenter, however, customers won't be able go inside.\\nStop &amp; Shop has an approximately 40,000-square-foot dark store in Whitman, Massachusetts, on the site of a former grocery store tailored to make deliveries.\\nAnd Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, is testing four dark stores. The inside looks similar to a store but without signs, according to a spokesperson for the company.\\nThe locations are designed to fill shoppers' online orders while allowing traditional stores to \"continue to serve the needs of those who enjoy the in-store experience,\" the Hy-Vee spokesperson said.\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of Stop &amp; Shop's 'dark store' in Massachusetts.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)The chilling story of Jayme Closs, the 13-year-old Wisconsin girl who was kidnapped after her parents were killed last year, was national news.\\nBut people might be less familiar with the story of Arianna Fitts, a 2-year-old who went missing in 2016 before her mother was found brutally murdered in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\nEach of these cases is compelling, but the two didn't receive the same amount of media attention. Some experts believe it's because Closs is white and Fitts is black.\\nIn fact, data shows that missing white children receive far more media coverage than missing black and brown children, despite higher rates of missing children among communities of color.\\nThe FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database lists 424,066 missing children under 18 in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. About 37 percent of those children are black, even though black children only make up about 14 percent of all children in the United States.\\nIt's harder to say how many Hispanic kids are missing. The FBI's report groups white and Hispanic children together. Based on other reports, about 20 percent of missing children are Hispanic or Latino, according to Robert Lowery, vice president of the missing child division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). But the real number, he said, is likely higher.\\n\"I think there's a false belief that white children make up the biggest number of missing children when in fact (proportionally) it's just the opposite,\" Lowery said, adding that the high number of black girls reported missing is particularly concerning.\\nHere are some reasons experts say we don't hear more about missing children of color:\\nTheir families are hesitant to call police\\nSome families are hesitant to contact law enforcement, even if they think their child is missing.\\n\"There's a sense of distrust between law enforcement and the minority community,\" said Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation.\\nThat distrust contributes to a \"silent code of 'no snitching,'\" Wilson said, adding that it is important for people who suspect a child is missing to speak up.\\n\"It could be your child, your mother, your father that's missing,\" she said. \"You would want someone to speak up to help find them.\"\\nOther families might not report that their child is missing because they fear it could have unintended, negative consequences. \\nFor example, Lowery suspects missing Latino children are underreported because some families with undocumented members might not contact police for fear of being deported. \\nThey don't get as much media coverage\\nNews media organizations have often been criticized for not giving missing black children the amount of attention they give missing white kids. \\nA 2010 study found that black children were significantly underrepresented in TV news. Even though about a third of all missing children in the FBI's database were black, they only made up about 20 percent of the missing children cases covered in the news. \\nA 2015 study was bleaker: though black children accounted for about 35% of missing children cases in the FBI's database, they amounted to only 7% of media references.\\nExperts say media coverage is vital to helping solve those cases.\\n\"It puts law enforcement on alert, and they add additional resources to the case,\" Wilson said. \"If no one knows about it, then no one's doing anything to find them or to help them get the assistance they need.\"\\nFamilies don't have the resources\\nFamilies don't always have the financial resources to respond appropriately when their child is missing. They might not be able to afford a private investigator or take off from work to help look for their child and follow up with law enforcement and the media. \\nAnd in some cases, they may not know what to do.\\nWilson said some people are under the misconception that they must wait 48 hours before filing a police report, when that waiting period varies by location. Places like Illinois or Washington, DC, don't have waiting periods to report a child missing.\\nKnowing the laws in your state helps. And when in doubt, contact law enforcement immediately. \\nThere are other resources that families can utilize as well.\\nThe Black and Missing Foundation helps families of color file police reports, create missing posters and spread the word about missing children.\\nFacebook groups offer an online community for parents to alert the public about their missing child and ask questions of others who have had similar experiences. \\nEliseo Montoya, who runs the Facebook group Runaway and Missing Children in California, said he keeps the page going because it allows families to feel like they're doing something even when it seems like authorities are giving up. \\n\"A page like mine is very important for people of color because nobody really embraces people of color,\" Montoya said.\\nSome get classified as runaways\\nWhen most people think of missing children, they think of young children abducted by strangers. But missing children can refer to kids who are abducted by relatives or children who leave home, either voluntarily or after being lured by someone else.\\nMany missing children of color are classified as runaways, Wilson said. And while running away from home isn't a problem unique to nonwhite children, they are particularly vulnerable. \\nA significant number of nonwhite children who go missing are either homeless or in foster care, said Wilson, and many are at risk for sex trafficking. Data shows black children are overrepresented in foster care and are at a much higher risk for homelessness. \\nLaw enforcement often classify children of color as runaways without having all the details, Wilson said. Because those kids are considered to have voluntarily left home, Amber alerts aren't sent out about them and they typically aren't covered in the news. \\nRunaway cases and abductions by family members don't get the same attention that abductions by non-family members or strangers do. But all these scenarios fall under the \"missing\" umbrella. A child is missing if they are under the age of 18 and their legal guardian doesn't know where they are.\\nThe NCMEC no longer distinguishes between runaways and abductions on their posters of missing children.\\n\"Frankly, we were dealing with a desensitized public and media when we did that,\" Lowery said. \"Now if you check our website, our children are just listed as missing child.\"\\nWilson stressed that runaway cases should be treated with the same urgency.\\n\"We have to be mindful,\" she said. \"What did they leave from, and what are they ultimately running to?\"\\nSometimes, children of color get classified as runaways when they are truly missing. Wilson said her organization has seen many such cases. \\n\"We tell parents all the time, you know your child better than anyone else, their behavior, their characteristics,\" she said. \"If you believe your child did not run away, you just have to stand firm with law enforcement and let them know that this is uncharacteristic of your child.\" \\n</td>\n",

Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?\\nThe answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\\nConsider what we've seen just since Friday:\\n1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card\\n2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\\n3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \\n4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\\n5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\\n6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \\n7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails\\nAnd in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\\nThe rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.\\nAt one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\\nAnd the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\\nFrom a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \\nBut by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\\nEven for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.\\nNow consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\\nThe real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?\\n</td>\n",

Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\\nWilliams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\\nPence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\\nLawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.\\nOver a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\\nSince then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\\nThe three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nCurrent and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\\nThe official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces. Until Williams joined Pence's staff, she was a spokesperson for several years at the US embassy in London, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also held posts at the embassies in Beirut, Lebanon and Kingston, Jamaica.\\n\"Jen is the type of person who I know to be dedicated to the institution above anything else,\" said Brett Bruen, the former Director of Global Engagement at the White House under President Barack Obama.\\nShe comes from the cadre of diplomats \"who are not going to be easily intimidated or hold back information,\" Bruen added. \"She is someone who is pretty tough and has had tough assignments that have steeled her to the kind of pressure and the intimidation tactics that have been used against others.\"\\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more precisely reflect Williams' role.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)It used to be said that \"all politics is local.\" That's not really the case anymore. \\nVoters may be casting ballots for politicians to state government, but their feelings about President Donald Trump will be paramount. That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \\nKentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \\nYet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \\nIf Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \\nThe same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \\nThe polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \\nYou can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \\nHood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \\nAfter the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \\nIf there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \\nThose slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \\nWere Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\\nI would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \\nStill, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\\n</td>\n",

Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state's attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   \\nTrump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor's office in the state. \\nTrump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin's victory came within 10 points of his opponent.\\nMedicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.\\nIn 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\\nBeshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \\nPolls close at 6 p.m. local time. \\nMississippi governor\\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  \\nTrump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \\nCook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\\nHood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \\nThere is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nVice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. \\nVirginia legislature \\nRepublicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\\nDemocrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\\nDemocrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.\\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.\\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)There are plenty of people arguing that President Donald Trump is breaking the law by encouraging news organizations to out the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine triggered the impeachment investigation.\\nHere's the problem with that view: The President is the law when it comes to protecting national security whistleblowers. And now it's the President who is leading the attack. \\n\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \\nHe's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\\nBut the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \\nThere are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\\nWhen that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\\nKohn added: \"If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\\nAnd Trump has made clear where he stands. \\nHe wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\\n\"It's a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\\nBut certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\\nThe whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\\nHarassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\\n\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\\nDevine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\\nHe ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\\nBut that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\\nAnd then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\\nBut no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \\n\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\\nToobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\\n\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\\nBut that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\\nUltimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)News footage from an October 20, 2018, midterm election rally in Nevada shows indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas standing behind President Donald Trump.\\nParnas and his business partner and fellow Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, are alleged by prosecutors to have illegally funded donations from foreign nations to Republican political campaigns in attempts to buy influence. They are also alleged to have aided Giuliani, the President's personal attorney, in efforts to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe video of the rally is the latest example of how the pair who had little record of donations to candidates before 2018, wielded their proximity to Giuliani and used political donations to gain access to the president and political campaigns. Photos and videos throughout 2018 and 2019 show the pair traveling with the former New York City mayor throughout the world and to political events across the country.\\nThe footage was found by CNN's KFile during a review of the travel and political activity of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman.\\nParnas and Fruman were arrested in October attempting to leave the country. They were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week to the charges. Parnas and Fruman were ordered to house confinement and subject to GPS monitoring after they each secured a $1 million bond. \\nIn the videos, Parnas sits in the area directly behind Trump before and during the rally.  Parnas, who at times is wearing a blue hat and glasses, can be seen apparently taking a video of the President on his cellphone as he walks up the stairs to the stage.\\nAt another point, Parnas leaves the area behind the podium to be along the path of the Trump's exit at the bottom of the stage. He waves to the president as he leaves, and the president waves back in the direction of Parnas and the crowd.\\nIt is unclear how Parnas, who is not a Nevada native, got into the prized seating area directly behind the President. A photo from Parnas' Instagram featured in a video by the Wall Street Journal shows he appeared to have a VIP badge for the event.\\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman since their indictment.\\n\"I don't know those gentlemen,\" the President said earlier this month. \"Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here.\"\\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump added. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do but I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy, I just don't know.\"\\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman returned a request for comment. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. A lawyer for Fruman did not return a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. \\nRally mentioned in indictments\\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York described the October 2018 rally in the 21-page indictment of Parnas, Fruman and their associates David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were both indicted on a conspiracy charge. Correia and Kukushkin have also pleaded not guilty.\\nThe prosecutors wrote that \"on or about October 20, 2018,\" Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for \"Candidate-1\" in Nevada and took photos with \"Candidate-2.\" The trio then sent the photographs to \"Foreign National-1,\" whose identity has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe candidates were later identified as Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wesley Duncan. Trump appeared at the rally to campaign for Laxalt. A photo from Parnas' now-private Instagram, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal, shows him and Fruman posing for a photograph with Laxalt previously during a September 2018 fundraiser. A spokesperson for Laxalt told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he \"doesn't know the man.\"\\nOne of several midterm events attended by Parnas and Fruman  \\nThe Trump rally in Nevada was one of many events attended by Fruman and Parnas in the final weeks heading up the November 2018 midterm elections.\\nIn photos posted on Twitter, Parnas and Fruman can be seen accompanying Giuliani to events in Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Indiana and again in Nevada.\\nA November 3, 2018, tweet of a several photos from Michigan Senate candidate John James shows James sitting at a table with Giuliani and Parnas. In another photo, James can be seen speaking while Fruman sits in the first row of seats and Parnas stand with Giuliani off to the side. \\nPictures tweeted that same day from Giuliani and congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian show Giuliani with Parnas and Fruman while campaigning in Nevada. A video from that morning also shows Fruman and Parnas with Giuliani as he campaigns in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun.\\nAnother campaign event for then-Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on November 4, 2018, shows Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman among attendees according to photos shared from DeSantis's Twitter account.\\nParnas was also seen with Giuliani at campaign events for New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Eddie Edwards. Photos posted on Twitter show Edwards and Giuliani addressing supporters at several campaign events on November 5, 2018 -- the day before the midterm election -- with Parnas standing near Giuliani.\\n</td>\n",

The campaign push, in the final week of this month, included offers to triple and even quintuple all donations.  \\nThe Trump campaign has been positioning itself this fall to be ready to capitalize on Trump's perceived accomplishments and political battles. \\nDuring the final game of the World Series earlier this week, the campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy, airing a video nationally which checked off the President's accomplishments and went after his Washington rivals. It focuses on Trump's efforts to combat ISIS and boost the economy, and it also highlights his battles with Democrats and the Russia investigation.\\nOn Friday, a day after the House vote, Facebook ads from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee asked supporters to \"add your name\" to the people willing to \"Stand with President Trump\" in the face of the impeachment inquiry.\\nSupporters then are encouraged to leave their names, email addresses, ZIP codes and mobile numbers.\\nIn a recent conference call with reporters, a Trump official called the reelection effort a \"digital first campaign\" that can swiftly seize on fast-moving news, such as developments in the impeachment inquiry, to target voters and test and tweak advertising messages on digital platforms.\\n\"They are running a highly sophisticated operation,\" Reid Vineis, vice president for digital at Republican ad-buying firm Majority Strategies, said of the Trump operation. \"The Trump campaign has been essentially building a database for the 2020 general election.\"\\nOf particular value: The campaign's collection of mobile phone numbers.\\n\"Politics is much more effective at a one-to-one level,\" Vineis said. \"Text messages are read almost 100% of the time.

       "      <td>Hong Kong (CNN Business)A growing number of smaller companies are adopting a four-day workweek. Now the results of a recent trial at Microsoft (MSFT) suggest it could work even for the biggest businesses.\\nThe company introduced a program this summer in Japan called the \"Work Life Choice Challenge,\" which shut down its offices every Friday in August and gave all employees an extra day off each week.\\nThe results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year, the company said in a statement last week. \\nIn addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails. \\nThey suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft's, of course).\\nThe effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft's 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company. \\nBy shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity. \\nThe initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — culture of overwork. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: karoshi means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.\\nThe issue attracted international attention in 2015, when an employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu committed suicide on Christmas Day. Tokyo officials later said that the staffer had worked excessive amounts of overtime.\\nTwo years later, a reporter at a Japanese broadcaster died after working punishing long hours. Her employer said she had clocked in 159 hours of overtime the month before her death.\\nThat has led businesses to start searching for solutions. Some companies have begun offering employees more flexibility, and the government has launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday,\" which encourages workers to leave early every last Friday of the month.\\nMicrosoft, for its part, says it will conduct another experiment in Japan later this year. It plans to ask employees to come up with new measures to improve work-life balance and efficiency, and will also ask other companies to join the initiative.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)Starbucks aims to get bigger by going smaller, with a new store format that's a fraction the size of its normal cafe. \\nThe coffee chain is opening \"Starbucks Pick-Up,\" a first-of-its-kind location in the United States that encourages orders from its app. The store, located near New York City's Penn Station, opens Tuesday. Plans for the store were announced in September.\\nThe new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company's vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want \"convenience, comfort and connection\" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. \\nYoung said the store is meant to be \"predictable and effortless\" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. \\nThe store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe's 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. \\nThe design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.\\nCustomers aren't required to order from Starbucks' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. \\nThe digitally focused store is part of the company's goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. \\nStarbucks Pick-Up will help the company \"test and learn\" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.\\nThe new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That's a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. \\nStarbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It's similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. \\nCEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' earnings call this week that it's \"seeing encouraging early results\" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China's largest cities. \\nBoth Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company's portfolio of stores that are \"tuned to different needs at different times,\" Young said. \\nOn the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world's largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November. The four-story Chicago location is 43,000 square feet and is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location on the city's Magnificent Mile.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)I had a pair of new $249 AirPods Pro for less than 12 minutes when one tumbled out of my ear and landed an inch from the edge of a train platform. \\n\"I really thought you were going to go after it if it fell,\" the stranger next to me scoffed.\\nThe high-end earbuds are a lot of things: an audiophile's dream, a fashion statement, Snoopy's face in headphone form. But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple's starting model, you'll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple's original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product. \\nIn a sense, this is Apple (AAPL) doing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones. \\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes, mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple's rivals. It's a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it's become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple's product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\\n Apple hasn't shared how many AirPods it's sold, but the company's wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it's hard not to believe it. \\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned, with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it's tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it's like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ. \\nFor those moments when you don't want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people's voices without sacrificing what you're listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual's ear canal's shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud. \\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it's still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem. \\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car. \\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I'd argue he's right. AirPod loyalists are fanatical about the earbuds, and the love for them is about to get even deeper. \\nBuzz around the new Pro version will undoubtedly convince other Apple users to make a purchase, too. They'll also soon know the pain and anguish of (almost) losing a fallen earpiece.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)On Monday night at a campaign rally in Kentucky, home state Sen. Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \\nHere's what Paul said:\\n\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'\"\\nPaul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information &amp; dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\\nWhile that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\\nWhat Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\\nThat's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\\nHere's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\\nThe task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\\nTo date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\\nFixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\\nBut thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\\nWhat Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\\nIt's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\\nTo which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)All eyes are on Kentucky Tuesday, as Gov. Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\\nI asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\nCillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\\nBailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\\nBevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\\nGoforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.\\nAttorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\\nCillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\\nBailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\\nBut there are some clear differences between the two. \\nThe President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\\nBevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\\nCillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\\nBailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\\nAndy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\\nHe also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\\nCillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\\nBailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\\nBailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\\nThe President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\\nTrump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)Faced with a slew of national polls that show roughly half the country supports not only his impeachment but also his removal from office, President Donald Trump did what he always does: Just say stuff.\\n\"Well, you're reading the wrong polls. You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You're read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\\nThat response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\\nA bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\\nOn Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \\n\"If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!\".\\nAnd then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \\n\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\\nPresumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\\nWhich is fine! And smart!\\n(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\\nBut if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \\nThink of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\\nThat's not to say Trump's \"real\" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.\\nAnd honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\\nWhy haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\\nNo matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)The Justice Department said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are \"legally invalid\" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.\\nThe guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.\\nImpeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.\\nIn the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\\nThe five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.\\nOLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\\nThe administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\\nThe memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\\n</td>\n",

His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\\nDuring the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\nThe anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\\nOn Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \\nZaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.\\nIn September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.\\nTwo sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\\n'Deeply troubling and disappointing' \\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.\\n\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,\" King said. \\n\"It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \\nLater on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\\nRaskin argued that the \"attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic\" that is a \"distraction from the merits of the case.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)While senators await the House of Representatives to move into the public phase of their impeachment inquiry, aides and members are beginning to prepare for a likely Senate trial.\\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are cautious: there are no articles of impeachment and the House hasn't voted to impeach the President. But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \\nTalks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. \\nThat room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\\nAnd, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\\n\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\\nSenate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.\\nSchumer's office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House's impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.\\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\\nSchumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\\nA key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\\nThere is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections. Both were in the Senate for Clinton's trial in January and February of 1999. Frequent Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a congressman from South Carolina, was also one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's defenses of his actions often change over time. They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. \\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" He claimed that the \"many people\" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.\\nThen he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\\nBreaking down Trump's comments\\nHere is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \\n\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\\nGot that?\\nLet's break it down claim by claim.\\n1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.\\n2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\\n3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\\n4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\\nIn summary: Trump went from\\nA) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to\\nB) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\\nC) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \\nD) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\\nHe can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:\\nA fact check\\nAs Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" \\nThe Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call's aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\\nThe whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \\nThe White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \\nTrump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\\nIt was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\\n</td>\n",

Under the sentence, Olsen is prohibited from working in law enforcement, possessing firearms or profiting from the case. \\nDear Jackson praised what she said was the strength, fortitude and compassion of the family of the victim, 26-year-old Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. She said she had also watched the defendant closely during the trial. \\n\"Many might have thought you were stoic and void of emotion,\" the judge told Olsen. \"From the time opening statements started, I saw the tears that you've had. I saw how you replayed March 9, 2015, in your head.\" \\nProsecutors had asked the court for a 25-year sentence with five years probation. \\nA jury last month acquitted Olsen of murder in the March 2015 death of Hill but found him guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath.\\nJurors deliberated for more than a week. Olsen had faced up to 35 years in prison.\\nBefore sentencing, the court heard from Hill's mother, father and sister.\\n\"The decision Robert Olsen made that day changed my life forever,\" said his mother, Carolyn Baylor Giummo. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\\nShe remembered her son as a compassionate child, a talented choir singer and student-athlete whose life seemed to change after his deployment to Afghanistan.   \\n\"He didn't come back unscathed,\" she said. At the time of the shooting, Hill had had stopped taking his medications because of side effects and suffered a breakdown, she said. \\nGiummo recalled her father always telling her and his grandchildren that \"if you're ever in trouble, run to the police.\"\\n\"The jury may have found Mr. Robert Olsen not guilty of murder but he still killed my son,\" she told the court. \"He has never taken responsibility for taking my son's life. He's never just said, 'I'm sorry for killing Tony.'\"\\n Anthony Hill, Sr., said he felt as if he had failed as a father for not protecting his son. He lamented that the defendant never once looked him in the eye with an expression of remorse. \\n\"I stood out in that passageway many a day just hoping to make a little bit of eye contact,\" he said. \"Not one time would he look my way.\"\\nOlsen's wife, Catherine, read a statement in court. She said one of the few times she saw her husband break down emotionally was after he killed Hill. \\n\"He was mourning for the individual whose life he had taken,\" she said, adding that she and Olsen recognize the pain of Hill's family. \\n\"I cannot imagine how hard this had been for his parents and family,\" she said.  \\nCatherine Olsen was overcome by emotion as her husband was taken away by officers after the sentencing.\\nOlsen did not address the court.\\nBefore the shooting, someone in Hill's neighborhood called police to report a man was \"acting deranged, knocking on doors, and crawling around on the ground naked,\" then-DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said then.\\nOlsen was dispatched, and \"when (Hill) saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer. The officer called him to stop while stepping backwards, drew his weapon and fired two shots,\" Alexander said.\\nDefense attorney Amanda Clark Palmer said Olsen, who worked for the DeKalb County police, was \"a good cop who had to make a tough decision.\"\\nHill's girlfriend previously said he had a history of mental illness and struggled to get the support he needed from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had stopped taking his medication shortly before his death, she said. \\nDuring closing arguments, the prosecution claimed Olsen did not follow protocol for using force. Assistant District Attorney Lance Cross said Olsen could have used a baton on Hill.\\n   \n",

hundreds of thousands of people remain without power after storms swept through much of the eastern US on Halloween. \\nRetired priest John Thomas Connery, 82, was on his way to a church in Newport, New York, on Thursday night, when he was swept away by floodwater, according to a deacon who worked with Connery at various churches in the area.\\nConnery disobeyed a traffic control signal and drove into a flooded area in Norway, New York, said Michael Kopy, the state's director of emergency management. Connery got out of his car after it got stuck when the shoulder of the road collapsed, Kopy said. He lost his footing and was swept away, New York State Police said in a release.\\nConnery, who had served for 56 years and lived about 60 miles away in Glenville, planned to spend the night in the rectory and lead the All Saints Day mass in Newport on Friday morning, Deacon Jim Bower of the Holy Family Parish in Hicksville, told CNN. \\n\"It's always a tragedy when anyone passes away and I think we always take it harder when its someone that we know and have a great deal of respect and love for,\" Bower said.\\nBishop Edward B. Scharfenberger of the Diocese of Albany said Father Connery \"died as he lived -- serving the people of God without fear or concern for himself.\"\\nGeorge Walker, 79, died after high winds caused a tree to fall on his car Thursday in Knoxville, Tennessee, said Knoxville Police communications manager Scott Erland.\\n Walker was taken to a local medical center and later died of his injuries, police said.\\n\"It was a horrible situation,\" Erland said.\\nNearly 600,000 customers remained without power Friday from Virginia to Maine after storms swept through Thursday evening. Most of the outages were reported in New York and Maine.\\nCon Edison workers were working to restore service in Queens, New York, near John F. Kennedy International Airport, CNN affiliate WABC reported.\\nWinds blew trees down, and roofing materials and debris were stuck in power lines, the station reported.\\nTens of thousands of customers were also without power in Pennsylvania, Vermont, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\\nMore than 20 low-temperature records were set Thursday from the Midwest to the East Coast, CNN meteorologists said.\\n   \n",

                                            Washington (CNN)The winner of Mississippi's gubernatorial election Tuesday will not only have to capture the state's popular vote, but will also have to prevail in the state's unique election process for electing a governor and other statewide officials that was established during the Jim Crow era. \\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state's popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as \"leans Republican\" -- the state's unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. \\nA candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nThe election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \\nCritics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\\nThe provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\\nWhile Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\\n   \n",
       "4    (CNN)Mary Kerrie Davis had smoked cigarettes for most of her adult life, when she embraced vaping as a way to quit.\\nFor several years, the 52-year-old mother from Georgia vaped only nicotine. But after trying THC cartridges, she began to experience health problems. On September 6, she died.\\nMary Kerrie's case sounds like the nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related injury confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of this week, the outbreak has led to 37 vaping-related deaths in 24 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands.\\nMany of those cases and deaths were among people who vaped THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.\\n\"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters in October. \"But I'd like to stress that we don't know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or way that the devices are producing harm.\"\\nMary Kerrie's death hasn't yet been counted in the CDC's total. Her grieving family has many questions still without answers. But they believe that vaping THC is what ultimately led to her death.\\nFrom smoking to vaping\\nWhen Mary Kerrie transitioned to vaping nicotine a few years ago, she stopped smoking cigarettes completely, her daughter, Maggie Davis, said. Mary Kerrie was adamant with family and friends that vaping was healthier than smoking.\\n\"She thought it was safer,\" her husband, Kevin Davis, said. \"I certainly liked the fact that there wasn't the cigarette smell and her breath didn't smell like cigarettes. I kind of thought it was better, too.\"\\nMaggie remembers that her mom came to California this summer to help her move into her dorm for her senior year of college. While there, Mary Kerrie went to a vape shop and purchased THC cartridges for the first time.\\nImmediately upon returning home, she developed a nagging cough. Kevin didn't know Mary Kerrie had been vaping THC cartridges. Only after her death did the Davis family learn that Mary Kerrie had continued buying and using THC cartridges in Georgia. Unlike in California, THC is illegal in the Davis' home state.\\n'I hope you don't have that vaping disease'\\nMary Kerrie experienced a steady decline in health between the time she started vaping THC cartridges and her death. The initial health effects she had experienced from vaping to quit smoking transitioned into frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a terrible cough. They're all among the reported symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\nMary Kerrie went to the hospital for assessment on September 4. A flu swab tested negative. She texted her daughter that she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nMaggie had just begun hearing reports of a national outbreak of a mystery illness related to vaping. She texted her mom, \"I hope you don't have that vaping disease.\"\\nOn the way home from the hospital, groaning between coughs, Mary Kerrie said, \"I'm never smoking again. I'm throwing out all of my e-cigarettes and weed pens,\" Maggie wrote in a personal essay for her college newspaper.\\nKevin, an OB/GYN, encouraged Mary Kerrie when she declared she was quitting it all.\\nStill, Mary Kerrie's symptoms became worse over the next two days. She stayed home from social gatherings, telling her husband that she just needed rest.\\nHe felt she should be seen again by a doctor.\\nDays later, on September 6, Mary Kerrie was still sick. It was Kevin who found her, lips blue and gasping for breath, whispering, \"help.\"\\nOn the way to the hospital again, Mary Kerrie's pulse was barely detectable. She'd become unresponsive.\\nAt the hospital, doctors performed CPR unsuccessfully.\\nMoments later, Mary Kerrie -- an outgoing 52-year-old who loved rollerskating and mountain biking, a mother and wife who was known for being vivacious and happy -- was gone.\\n\"She will never see her youngest daughter graduate high school, nor her oldest graduate college,\" Maggie wrote after her death. \"She will never see her daughters married or meet her grandchildren. Her absence, a sudden and jarring hole in my family, will be felt for decades to come.\"\\nIn X-rays on the day Mary Kerrie presented at the hospital, her lungs had looked clear. Two days later, they revealed a white substance resembling clouds infiltrating Mary Kerrie's lungs.\\n'From healthy to drowning in your own lungs'\\nTo the Davis family, the X-rays seemed to confirm what they had heard in the news: Mary Kerrie's illness wasn't simply a case of pneumonia. In addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain, the whiteout in her lungs was one of the symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\n\"This wasn't a nursing home patient. This wasn't somebody with a chronic illness,\" Kevin said. \"You don't just go from healthy to drowning in your own lungs and a flatline EKG from things in your daily life.\"\\nNearly two months after Mary Kerrie's death, her case is still not part of the official CDC count of vaping-related lung injury deaths.\\nIn part, it speaks to just how new of a phenomenon this is. The ongoing investigation \"may take a few months\" and could yield \"multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\" CDC's Schuchat told reporters early in October.\\nFor the Davis family, the wait has been frustrating. To them, it seems obvious that Mary Kerrie's death is related to vaping.\\nKevin said he recently spoke with a CDC official who said that his wife's case met the agency's definition of a vaping-related illness, but the agency is waiting for the county medical examiner's decision before making an announcement.\\nThere have already been three confirmed vaping-related deaths in Georgia. If and when it is announced, Mary Kerrie's death could be the fourth, potentially making Georgia's death count the highest in the United States.\\nMary Kerrie's legacy\\nThe Davis family and Mary Kerrie's friends want her to be remembered for the good she brought into their lives.\\n\"She was all in on me and all in on our daughters, all in on her family. Anything that she wanted to be a part of, it was everything for her,\" Kevin said of their 24-year marriage. \"Her energy is beautiful, and I sure miss her.\"\\nThe Davis family attributes part of the blame for Mary Kerrie's death to a lack of regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration.\\n\"Marijuana pens also boast exponentially higher numbers of THC, and yet we still do not know how this historically disproportionate consumption of marijuana affects the human body, particularly when consumed as an oil,\" Maggie wrote.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA warned consumers to stop using THC vaping products as investigations into vaping-related lung injuries and deaths continue. Last week, the CDC made a similar warning, saying \"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC.\"\\n\"Mary Kerrie vaped [nicotine] products for several years I would say, successfully, and did quit smoking,\" Kevin said. \"I think when she was exposed to legal THC in California and then got illicit THC in Georgia ... I think that's what killed her.\"\\n\"Other people, if they're being exposed to something that can kill them, I hope they stop,\" Kevin said. \"I hope her passing helps somebody else.\"\\n   \n",

fundraising figure that he said was necessary in order to continue his campaign.\\nThe Castro campaign received more than $1 million in October from \"nearly 50,000 donors,\" according to a campaign statement, and on Thursday the campaign enjoyed its best fundraising day since August.\\nCastro had previously said that if he did not reach the $800,000 figure before the end of the month, he would have to end his 2020 bid. Fundraising has been a struggle for Castro, with the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor entering the fourth quarter of 2019 with less than $700,000 in the bank.\\n\"Time and time again this campaign has defied expectations with the support of an army of dedicated, grassroots supporters,\" Castro campaign manager Maya Rupert said in a statement Friday. \"We set an extremely ambitious goal to keep Secretary Castro's voice in this race, and our supporters met the challenge and delivered one of the best months of the campaign to date.\"\\nThe announcement of Castro's fundraising comes as the candidate heads to Iowa, a key early voting state, for the weekend to discuss affordable housing, according to the statement.\\nCastro has not yet qualified for the November debate, having failed to reach the 3% polling threshold despite meeting the donor requirement.\\n   \n",

              New York  (CNN Business)Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash pile keeps expanding, but Warren Buffett's industrial and insurance conglomerate has yet to make a major acquisition to ramp up growth.\\nBerkshire on Saturday reported it has $128 billion in cash, up from $122 billion in the second quarter.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has lagged the market this year, and Buffett has said that he wants to make an \"elephant\" sized acquisition with the company's mountain of cash. The problem is that the market rally has made any potential targets much more expensive, and Buffett has said he doesn't want to overspend on deals.\\nBerkshire's operating profit rose to $7.9 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year earlier, boosted by gains across its holdings. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's performance is tied to its many subsidiaries -- which include GEICO, railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe and consumer brands like Duracell, Dairy Queen and paint maker Benjamin Moore -- as well as a massive investment portfolio.\\nBerkshire also said tariffs from the US-China trade war weighed on its consumer and industrial businesses. The tariffs cut into sales of Precision Castparts, it gas turbine and pipe products unit, the filings said. BNSF railroad saw a 5% profit gain due to cost-cutting measures to offset a drag from trade tensions.\\nWhile Berkshire has yet to make a major acquisition, the company has been taking steps to embrace more reasonably valued tech stocks in recent years. Berkshire Hathaway still owns large stakes in value stalwarts like Coke, (KO) Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX) and Kraft Heinz, (KHC) which has taken billions of dollars in writedowns this year on some of its top brands.\\nBut the company's biggest holding now is Apple (AAPL), and Berkshire even has a small stake in Amazon (AMZN).\\nBerkshire Hathaway also purchased $700 million of its own stock in the third quarter, an uptick from the $442 million it bought last quarter. The company purchased $1.7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter.\\nPreviously, the company did not allow stock buybacks. The board changed a rule last year to allow the company to begin purchasing back billions of dollars worth of stock, a practice that has been criticized by some analysts as inflating share prices.\\n   \n",

Today, roughly one in every four orders at McDonald's includes a Happy Meal, according to retail data tracker Sense360. \\nEach Happy Meal contains the option of a hamburger or chicken nuggets, a side like french fries and a drink. And a toy, some of which have become collector's items. \\nMcDonald's is celebrating this milestone by re-releasing some of its most popular toys over the past four decades, including Ty Beanie Babies' Patti the Platypus and the Tamagotchi. Between November 7 through 11, McDonald's (MCD) will sell a \"Surprise Happy Meal\" in 90 countries that will include the throwback toys.\\nIt's the latest quick-service restaurant to tap into nostalgia to excite customers. Since fast-food customers are not particularly loyal to any brand,  fast-food companies must resort to marketing tactics or wacky food creations to draw in customers.\\nHere's a brief history of the Happy Meal:\\n1979\\nThe Circus Wagon Happy Meal, as it was originally known, launched in the United States in June 1979. The meal included a hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and cookies. Some of the early Happy Meal toys included a McDoodler stencil, McWrist wallet and a spinning top. The box became instantly recognizable with the meal. \\n1982\\nAfter becoming a hit in the United States, McDonald's expanded the meal internationally. It debuted first in Latin America before hitting Australia and New Zealand. \\n1984\\nMcDonald's added McNuggets as a Happy Meal option. The addition inspired a line of Happy Meal toys modeled after the McNuggets.\\n1991\\nMcDonald's partnered with United Airlines (UAL) to offer Happy Meals on some of its flights. The deal ended in 2001.\\n1998\\nThe first-ever global Happy Meal debuted with Disney film \"Mulan.\" The meal had identical packaging and toys across 40 countries.\\n2012 - 2013\\nAs its customers shifted toward healthier eating habits, McDonald's began overhauling the Happy Meal. In 2012, McDonald's made the french fries portion smaller, and it added fruit as an option. In 2013, it added milk or juice as beverage choices.\\n2018\\nMcDonald's said it would provide cheeseburgers in Happy Meals only upon request. It removed artificial preservatives from some of its entrees and added bottled water as a drink option.

Hasbro's chief rival, Mattel (MAT), enjoyed a sales surge of 3% over the same period. Both toy companies' success was largely tied to Toys \"R\" Us prior to the retailer's financial demise and rebirth.\\nThe revamped Toys \"R\" Us will open two streamlined locations ahead of Black Friday in Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and The Galleria in Houston.\\n\"We know that customers love shopping as a means of entertainment. That's something built into the DNA of human beings,\" Richard Barry, president and CEO of Toys \"R\" Us parent company, Tru Kids, told CNN Business. \"We also know kids and families are looking for things to do on the weekends or when school's out. We know parents and families really value play and the value of toys overall. As we thought about the strategy, we wanted to put all those things together.\"\\nThese are not simply stores, according to the company. The store chain will partner with the retail service startup B8ta to create hands-on, engaging experiences for kids and their parents, who may have fond memories of Toys \"R\" Us from their own childhoods.\\nThe old Toys \"R\" Us stores were 40,000-square-foot behemoths with merchandise stacked on endless rows of metal shelves. The new stores are about 6,500 square feet, with interactive spaces where kids and parents can play with toys.\\nThe revalitized Toys \"R\" Us website also showcases fewer toys, but gives more details on them. Those looking to purchase items are redirected to Target's (TGT) website, which provides inventory and fulfillment services.\\nB8ta, which designs interactive stores displays where shoppers can try the latest products, will bring theaters, video games, and other engaging items to the new Toys \"R\" Us stores.\\n\"We've got a huge treehouse in the middle of the store that kids will be able to climb into, an event space for movies in the store. We'll have great brands in the store,\" Barry said.\\nJohn Goodman, CEO of Candytopia, helped implement this \"shop-o-tainment\" idea two years ago before partnering with Toys \"R\" Us earlier this year to launch \"Toys R Us Adventure,\" a touring indoor play space appearing in select malls across the country for a limited time. The ticketed attraction costs $20 for children ages 4-12 and $28 for adults. It features toy-themed play areas for small children who, the company hopes, will bug their parents to buy them merchandise associated with the fun zones they've just finished exploring. \\nThese pop-up playlands aren't permanent stores. After about six months they will set up shop somewhere else.\\nGoodman, who previously served as CEO of The Gap (GPS), Kmart, and Sears, used a similar blueprint to help Candytopia founder Jackie Sorkin turn her birthday party and event business into a multi-million dollar, confection-themed touring attraction celebrated by celebrity influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore.\\nToys \"R\" Adventure's first run in Chicago and Atlanta generated national headlines last week as families celebrated the return of the familiar retail brand.  Pictures and videos of smiling, laughing children walking through imitation snow caves and interacting with the Toys \"R\" Us mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, are circulating now on Instagram and Facebook.\\nThe Toys \"R\" Us Adventure in Atlanta's Lenox Marketplace shopping complex was nearly filled to capacity, Goodman said. \\n\"We feel like we're adding a service to the mall in terms of driving additional traffic, anything from 1,700 to 2,200 people every single day,\" Goodman told CNN Business. \"It's like the circus. The circus comes to town and the circus leaves. It may or may not be back in a couple of years. That's how our model is built.\"\\nThis idea isn't exactly new, but it is catching on elsewhere. The minds behind New Jersey's new American Dream mall, which opened on Friday, came up with a similar concept. The Rutherford, New Jersey shopping complex is less a place to buy consumer goods and more of an indoor theme park with cartoon-themed attractions in its Nickelodeon Universe. It also has an indoor ski slope, a water park, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink.\\nScott Webb, CEO of the digital consulting firm Avionos, says this may be the future of toy-related, brick-and-mortar retail shopping. Encouraging kids to play with toys that aren't tied to TV, movie, or video game characters is crucial for the industry, which has struggled in an era when children binge watching shows on streaming services often avoid commercials advertising toys that they won't see on their favorite shows.\\n\"Kids as much as anything are digital consumers now,\" Webb told CNN Business. \"The Hasbro numbers back this up. The segments of toys that have really thrived are those tied to some intellectual property, whether it's Fortnite or Marvel or Star Wars.\" \\nWebb said Toys \"R\" Us turning its company into a toy discovery brand as opposed to a retailer may be a good strategy. \"I think they absolutely have a lot of brand equity to carve out a new niche in that role,\" he continued. \"But I think it would be hard to predict them ever discovering the same dominance in retail.\"\\n   \n",

And workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is expensive for grocers. That's why grocers are looking to technology to reduce costs and keep aisles from jamming up.\\n'Micro-fulfillment centers' \\nAlbertsons and Stop & Shop are testing automated \"micro-fulfillment centers\" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.\\nStop & Shop, owned by Dutch parent Ahold Delhaize, is building a 12,000-square-foot fully automated fulfillment center in the backroom of a store in Windsor, Connecticut, for deliveries in the Hartford area. Stop & Shop offers delivery through its online Peapod service.\\nMeijer announced this month that it will also begin testing micro-fulfillment with a logistics company to \"maximize space in our stores\" and expand online options, said Sid Handa, the company's director of strategic supply chain initiatives.\\nAnd in Salem, New Hampshire, Walmart is piloting a system with autonomous carts that gather customers' grocery orders and bring them to Walmart workers, who then prepare them for delivery or pickup.\\nSome analysts say these models are an advantage over large, centralized warehouses, which are often located further away from customers than stores. That's why micro-fulfillment centers can save grocers in delivery costs, according to experts.\\n\"Micro-fulfillment helps retailers solve the labor and last-mile costs conundrum,\" Christopher Mandeville, analyst at Jefferies, said in a research report earlier this month. \\nMandeville estimates that the cost of delivering groceries from central warehouses is usually around two times higher than using micro-fulfillment in stores. Jefferies cut Kroger's stock earlier this month in part because the company has invested in centralized facilities through a deal with Ocado, instead of micro-fulfillment.\\nGrocers are also moving the picking process out of stores entirely and testing so-called dark stores. Some dark stores have automation, while others are still manned by employees to do all of the picking of goods purchased online, said Mandeville.\\n\"Dark stores in grocery are an emerging trend,\" said Michael Demko, founder of grocery consulting firm Locai Solutions.\\nWalmart recently opened Walmart Pickup Point, a 40,000-square-foot prototype outside of Chicago at a former Dominick's grocery store. Customers drive up to the site to designated parking spots, and a Walmart worker loads up their trunk with their order. Walmart can also make deliveries from the location. \\nThe inside of the location looks like a Walmart with groceries and everyday items. Unlike a traditional Walmart supercenter, however, customers won't be able go inside.\\nStop & Shop has an approximately 40,000-square-foot dark store in Whitman, Massachusetts, on the site of a former grocery store tailored to make deliveries.\\nAnd Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, is testing four dark stores. The inside looks similar to a store but without signs, according to a spokesperson for the company.\\nThe locations are designed to fill shoppers' online orders while allowing traditional stores to \"continue to serve the needs of those who enjoy the in-store experience,\" the Hy-Vee spokesperson said.\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of Stop & Shop's 'dark store' in Massachusetts.\\n   \n",

(WIAT) — Liz Landgren has always loved to draw and paint, but she never realized she had a gift until adulthood. \\n“[I realized] it can be something that I can use for all kinds of things,” Landgren said.\\nThroughout her career, she’s painted all sorts of figures and creatures. But to her, no painting has ever been as important as her most recent piece: a portrait of Aniah Blanchard, the 19-year-old Southern Union student who has been missing for over a week. \\nAs she describes it, this painting had a mission.\\n“I thought ‘what can I do to make people look twice and look and see Aniah?'” she said.\\nAnd people have. \\nThe painting of Blanchard, a Homewood native, was the final product of a time-lapse video she made showing the process start to finish with fastidious attention paid to every detail. \\n\\nMISSING – Aniah Blanchard, from Homewood Alabama, went missing from AUBURN on Wednesday night. I’m hoping that this time…Posted by Liz DeFuniak Landgren on Monday, October 28, 2019\\n\\n“I’ve memorized the shape of her face, the shape of her eyes,” she said. “It’s just a way to take that second glance.”\\nThe video has been viewed over 30,000 times and the original painting has been gifted to Blanchard’s family. Before the investigation began, Landgren says she didn’t know them personally, but that didn’t stop her from wanting to help. \\n“I don’t know, it’s just hit me so hard,” Landgren said with tears in her eyes. “She is one of our children. If this were my child, what would I want people to be doing? Everything. We’ve gotta find her. We’ve gotta find her. “\\nLangren said the community is welcome to download and share the Blanchard portrait across social media.\\n\\nThe investigation is ongoing and anyone with information regarding Aniah’s whereabouts, or other knowledge about the case is asked to call the Auburn Police Division Detective Section at 334-501-3140, the anonymous tip line at 334-246-1391 or the 24 hour non-emergency number at 334-501-3100. \\n\\nLATEST POSTS\\n‘Enough is enough’: Stop the Violence Conference held in Birmingham\\nPresident Trump declares November National Veterans and Military Families Month\\nTexas search group joins effort to find Aniah Blanchard\\nNix, No. 11 Auburn hold on, 20-14 over Ole Miss\\nNew Alabama Democratic Party chair elected after infighting\\n\\n\\n   \n",

Some experts believe it's because Closs is white and Fitts is black.\\nIn fact, data shows that missing white children receive far more media coverage than missing black and brown children, despite higher rates of missing children among communities of color.\\nThe FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database lists 424,066 missing children under 18 in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. About 37 percent of those children are black, even though black children only make up about 14 percent of all children in the United States.\\nIt's harder to say how many Hispanic kids are missing. The FBI's report groups white and Hispanic children together. Based on other reports, about 20 percent of missing children are Hispanic or Latino, according to Robert Lowery, vice president of the missing child division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). But the real number, he said, is likely higher.\\n\"I think there's a false belief that white children make up the biggest number of missing children when in fact (proportionally) it's just the opposite,\" Lowery said, adding that the high number of black girls reported missing is particularly concerning.\\nHere are some reasons experts say we don't hear more about missing children of color:\\nTheir families are hesitant to call police\\nSome families are hesitant to contact law enforcement, even if they think their child is missing.\\n\"There's a sense of distrust between law enforcement and the minority community,\" said Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation.\\nThat distrust contributes to a \"silent code of 'no snitching,'\" Wilson said, adding that it is important for people who suspect a child is missing to speak up.\\n\"It could be your child, your mother, your father that's missing,\" she said. \"You would want someone to speak up to help find them.\"\\nOther families might not report that their child is missing because they fear it could have unintended, negative consequences. \\nFor example, Lowery suspects missing Latino children are underreported because some families with undocumented members might not contact police for fear of being deported. \\nThey don't get as much media coverage\\nNews media organizations have often been criticized for not giving missing black children the amount of attention they give missing white kids. \\nA 2010 study found that black children were significantly underrepresented in TV news. Even though about a third of all missing children in the FBI's database were black, they only made up about 20 percent of the missing children cases covered in the news. \\nA 2015 study was bleaker: though black children accounted for about 35% of missing children cases in the FBI's database, they amounted to only 7% of media references.\\nExperts say media coverage is vital to helping solve those cases.\\n\"It puts law enforcement on alert, and they add additional resources to the case,\" Wilson said. \"If no one knows about it, then no one's doing anything to find them or to help them get the assistance they need.\"\\nFamilies don't have the resources\\nFamilies don't always have the financial resources to respond appropriately when their child is missing. They might not be able to afford a private investigator or take off from work to help look for their child and follow up with law enforcement and the media. \\nAnd in some cases, they may not know what to do.\\nWilson said some people are under the misconception that they must wait 48 hours before filing a police report, when that waiting period varies by location. Places like Illinois or Washington, DC, don't have waiting periods to report a child missing.\\nKnowing the laws in your state helps. And when in doubt, contact law enforcement immediately. \\nThere are other resources that families can utilize as well.\\nThe Black and Missing Foundation helps families of color file police reports, create missing posters and spread the word about missing children.\\nFacebook groups offer an online community for parents to alert the public about their missing child and ask questions of others who have had similar experiences. \\nEliseo Montoya, who runs the Facebook group Runaway and Missing Children in California, said he keeps the page going because it allows families to feel like they're doing something even when it seems like authorities are giving up. \\n\"A page like mine is very important for people of color because nobody really embraces people of color,\" Montoya said.\\nSome get classified as runaways\\nWhen most people think of missing children, they think of young children abducted by strangers. But missing children can refer to kids who are abducted by relatives or children who leave home, either voluntarily or after being lured by someone else.\\nMany missing children of color are classified as runaways, Wilson said. And while running away from home isn't a problem unique to nonwhite children, they are particularly vulnerable. \\nA significant number of nonwhite children who go missing are either homeless or in foster care, said Wilson, and many are at risk for sex trafficking. Data shows black children are overrepresented in foster care and are at a much higher risk for homelessness. \\nLaw enforcement often classify children of color as runaways without having all the details, Wilson said. Because those kids are considered to have voluntarily left home, Amber alerts aren't sent out about them and they typically aren't covered in the news. \\nRunaway cases and abductions by family members don't get the same attention that abductions by non-family members or strangers do. But all these scenarios fall under the \"missing\" umbrella. A child is missing if they are under the age of 18 and their legal guardian doesn't know where they are.\\nThe NCMEC no longer distinguishes between runaways and abductions on their posters of missing children.\\n\"Frankly, we were dealing with a desensitized public and media when we did that,\" Lowery said. \"Now if you check our website, our children are just listed as missing child.\"\\nWilson stressed that runaway cases should be treated with the same urgency.\\n\"We have to be mindful,\" she said. \"What did they leave from, and what are they ultimately running to?\"\\nSometimes, children of color get classified as runaways when they are truly missing. Wilson said her organization has seen many such cases. \\n\"We tell parents all the time, you know your child better than anyone else, their behavior, their characteristics,\" she said. \"If you believe your child did not run away, you just have to stand firm with law enforcement and let them know that this is uncharacteristic of your child.\" \\n   \n",

Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?\\nThe answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\\nConsider what we've seen just since Friday:\\n1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card\\n2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\\n3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \\n4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\\n5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\\n6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \\n7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails\\nAnd in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\\nThe rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.\\nAt one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\\nAnd the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\\nFrom a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \\nBut by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\\nEven for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.\\nNow consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\\nThe real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?\\n   \n",

acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney testify on Capitol Hill on Friday, ratcheting up their investigation to target the President's top aide.\\nThe House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees sent Mulvaney a letter Tuesday requesting he appear for a closed-door deposition as part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. \\n\"We believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the House's impeachment inquiry,\" the Democratic chairs wrote.\\nIt appears unlikely that Mulvaney will comply with the request. \\nSo far this week, six Trump administration officials have defied requests for their testimony, and several more are expected to do the same later this week, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought.\\nMulvaney and the White House have already failed to respond to a subpoena from the Democrats for documents, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent House Democrats a lengthy letter arguing that the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate.\\n   \n",

Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\\nWilliams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\\nPence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\\nLawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.\\nOver a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\\nSince then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\\nThe three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nCurrent and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\\nThe official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces.

That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \\nKentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \\nYet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \\nIf Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \\nThe same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \\nThe polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \\nYou can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \\nHood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \\nAfter the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \\nIf there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \\nThose slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \\nWere Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\\nI would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \\nStill, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\\n   \n",

The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. \\nAll eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates.\\nHere's a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: \\nKentucky governor \\nRepublican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state's attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   \\nTrump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor's office in the state. \\nTrump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin's victory came within 10 points of his opponent.\\nMedicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.\\nIn 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\\nBeshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \\nPolls close at 6 p.m. local time. \\nMississippi governor\\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  \\nTrump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \\nCook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\\nHood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \\nThere is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nVice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. \\nVirginia legislature \\nRepublicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\\nDemocrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\\nDemocrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.\\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.\\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET.\\n   \n",

And now it's the President who is leading the attack. \\n\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \\nHe's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\\nBut the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \\nThere are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\\nWhen that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\\nKohn added: \"If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\\nAnd Trump has made clear where he stands. \\nHe wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\\n\"It's a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\\nBut certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\\nThe whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\\nHarassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\\n\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\\nDevine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\\nHe ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\\nBut that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\\nAnd then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\\nBut no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \\n\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\\nToobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\\n\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\\nBut that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\\nUltimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\\n   \n",

They are also alleged to have aided Giuliani, the President's personal attorney, in efforts to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe video of the rally is the latest example of how the pair who had little record of donations to candidates before 2018, wielded their proximity to Giuliani and used political donations to gain access to the president and political campaigns. Photos and videos throughout 2018 and 2019 show the pair traveling with the former New York City mayor throughout the world and to political events across the country.\\nThe footage was found by CNN's KFile during a review of the travel and political activity of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman.\\nParnas and Fruman were arrested in October attempting to leave the country. They were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week to the charges. Parnas and Fruman were ordered to house confinement and subject to GPS monitoring after they each secured a $1 million bond. \\nIn the videos, Parnas sits in the area directly behind Trump before and during the rally.  Parnas, who at times is wearing a blue hat and glasses, can be seen apparently taking a video of the President on his cellphone as he walks up the stairs to the stage.\\nAt another point, Parnas leaves the area behind the podium to be along the path of the Trump's exit at the bottom of the stage. He waves to the president as he leaves, and the president waves back in the direction of Parnas and the crowd.\\nIt is unclear how Parnas, who is not a Nevada native, got into the prized seating area directly behind the President. A photo from Parnas' Instagram featured in a video by the Wall Street Journal shows he appeared to have a VIP badge for the event.\\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman since their indictment.\\n\"I don't know those gentlemen,\" the President said earlier this month. \"Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here.\"\\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump added. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do but I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy, I just don't know.\"\\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman returned a request for comment. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. A lawyer for Fruman did not return a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. \\nRally mentioned in indictments\\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York described the October 2018 rally in the 21-page indictment of Parnas, Fruman and their associates David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were both indicted on a conspiracy charge. Correia and Kukushkin have also pleaded not guilty.\\nThe prosecutors wrote that \"on or about October 20, 2018,\" Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for \"Candidate-1\" in Nevada and took photos with \"Candidate-2.\" The trio then sent the photographs to \"Foreign National-1,\" whose identity has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe candidates were later identified as Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wesley Duncan. Trump appeared at the rally to campaign for Laxalt. A photo from Parnas' now-private Instagram, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal, shows him and Fruman posing for a photograph with Laxalt previously during a September 2018 fundraiser. A spokesperson for Laxalt told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he \"doesn't know the man.\"\\nOne of several midterm events attended by Parnas and Fruman  \\nThe Trump rally in Nevada was one of many events attended by Fruman and Parnas in the final weeks heading up the November 2018 midterm elections.\\nIn photos posted on Twitter, Parnas and Fruman can be seen accompanying Giuliani to events in Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Indiana and again in Nevada.\\nA November 3, 2018, tweet of a several photos from Michigan Senate candidate John James shows James sitting at a table with Giuliani and Parnas. In another photo, James can be seen speaking while Fruman sits in the first row of seats and Parnas stand with Giuliani off to the side. \\nPictures tweeted that same day from Giuliani and congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian show Giuliani with Parnas and Fruman while campaigning in Nevada. A video from that morning also shows Fruman and Parnas with Giuliani as he campaigns in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun.\\nAnother campaign event for then-Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on November 4, 2018, shows Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman among attendees according to photos shared from DeSantis's Twitter account.\\nParnas was also seen with Giuliani at campaign events for New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Eddie Edwards. Photos posted on Twitter show Edwards and Giuliani addressing supporters at several campaign events on November 5, 2018 -- the day before the midterm election -- with Parnas standing near Giuliani.\\n   \n",

                                     (CNN)A new survey of likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers from the New York Times and Siena College finds a tight top tier of four in Iowa, with no clear leader in the first state to weigh in on the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\nIn Friday's poll, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has the support of 22%, with a tight cluster of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (19%), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and Former Vice President Joe Biden (17%) all within striking distance of Warren.\\nThe results in the early voting state do not bode well for Biden and are similar to a September CNN/Des Moines Regiser/Mediacom poll in which Warren challenged Biden's dominance in the race. \\nThis also marks a jump for Buttigieg, who previously lagged behind the three longstanding frontrunners and clocked in at 9% in CNN's poll in Iowa last month.\\nBehind them, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar lands at 4%, and California Sen. Kamala Harris and businessman Andrew Yang at 3% each in Friday's poll. The poll is Klobuchar's second poll that meets the standard to qualify for the December Democratic presidential debate, which requires 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC's criteria or 6% in two early state polls between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12.\\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Tom Steyer all garnered 2% of support.\\nTwo-thirds of likely caucusgoers in the poll said they could still change their minds about whom to support.\\nThe Times/Siena survey was conducted from Oct. 25-30, questioned 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\\n   \n",

                              Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's campaign says House Democrats' vote to formally launch an impeachment inquiry has only emboldened the President's supporters and bolstered their campaign contributions. \\n\"Nancy Pelosi's impeachment resolution day turned into a MASSIVE fundraising day for ??@realDonaldTrump?,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Friday morning. \\nAccording to Parscale, the campaign raised $3 million online in one day, totaling $19 million in funds raised over the course of the month. \\nThe $3 million addition came the same day the House passed the resolution, which the campaign called a \"sham.\" \\n\"Today's vote merely proves that the entire impeachment process was a sham from the beginning and Nancy Pelosi can't legitimize it after the fact,\" Parscale said in a statement following the resolution vote. \"Voters will punish Democrats who support this farce and President Trump will be easily re-elected.\"\\nTrump's one-day haul highlights his campaign's heavy use of digital advertising to reach potential supporters and donors -- a year ahead of the 2020 election.\\nThe campaign's heaviest spending isn't in swing states, such as Michigan or Pennsylvania, but in donor-rich parts of the country, such as Texas and California, according to a CNN tally of Facebook advertising data compiled by the Democratic-leaning firm Bully Pulpit Interactive.\\nThe Lone Star State received the biggest share of Facebook spending by the Trump campaign and its affiliated Trump Make America Great Again Committee since late March of this year -- nearly 9% of its total spending on the platform, the data show.\\nThe fundraising bump also came during the final days of the month, a period when nearly all active political campaigns rally supporters to ramp up contributions ahead of the close of the monthly report to the Federal Election Commission. The campaign push, in the final week of this month, included offers to triple and even quintuple all donations.  \\nThe Trump campaign has been positioning itself this fall to be ready to capitalize on Trump's perceived accomplishments and political battles. \\nDuring the final game of the World Series earlier this week, the campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy, airing a video nationally which checked off the President's accomplishments and went after his Washington rivals. It focuses on Trump's efforts to combat ISIS and boost the economy, and it also highlights his battles with Democrats and the Russia investigation.\\nOn Friday, a day after the House vote, Facebook ads from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee asked supporters to \"add your name\" to the people willing to \"Stand with President Trump\" in the face of the impeachment inquiry.\\nSupporters then are encouraged to leave their names, email addresses, ZIP codes and mobile numbers.\\nIn a recent conference call with reporters, a Trump official called the reelection effort a \"digital first campaign\" that can swiftly seize on fast-moving news, such as developments in the impeachment inquiry, to target voters and test and tweak advertising messages on digital platforms.\\n\"They are running a highly sophisticated operation,\" Reid Vineis, vice president for digital at Republican ad-buying firm Majority Strategies, said of the Trump operation. \"The Trump campaign has been essentially building a database for the 2020 general election.\"\\nOf particular value: The campaign's collection of mobile phone numbers.\\n\"Politics is much more effective at a one-to-one level,\" Vineis said. \"Text messages are read almost 100% of the time.

Now the results of a recent trial at Microsoft (MSFT) suggest it could work even for the biggest businesses.\\nThe company introduced a program this summer in Japan called the \"Work Life Choice Challenge,\" which shut down its offices every Friday in August and gave all employees an extra day off each week.\\nThe results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year, the company said in a statement last week. \\nIn addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails. \\nThey suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft's, of course).\\nThe effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft's 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company. \\nBy shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity. \\nThe initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — culture of overwork. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: karoshi means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.\\nThe issue attracted international attention in 2015, when an employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu committed suicide on Christmas Day. Tokyo officials later said that the staffer had worked excessive amounts of overtime.\\nTwo years later, a reporter at a Japanese broadcaster died after working punishing long hours. Her employer said she had clocked in 159 hours of overtime the month before her death.\\nThat has led businesses to start searching for solutions. Some companies have begun offering employees more flexibility, and the government has launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday,\" which encourages workers to leave early every last Friday of the month.\\nMicrosoft, for its part, says it will conduct another experiment in Japan later this year. It plans to ask employees to come up with new measures to improve work-life balance and efficiency, and will also ask other companies to join the initiative.\\n   \n",

Plans for the store were announced in September.\\nThe new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company's vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want \"convenience, comfort and connection\" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. \\nYoung said the store is meant to be \"predictable and effortless\" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. \\nThe store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe's 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. \\nThe design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.\\nCustomers aren't required to order from Starbucks' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. \\nThe digitally focused store is part of the company's goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. \\nStarbucks Pick-Up will help the company \"test and learn\" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.\\nThe new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That's a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. \\nStarbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It's similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. \\nCEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' earnings call this week that it's \"seeing encouraging early results\" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China's largest cities. \\nBoth Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company's portfolio of stores that are \"tuned to different needs at different times,\" Young said. \\nOn the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world's largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November. The four-story Chicago location is 43,000 square feet and is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location on the city's Magnificent Mile.\\n   \n",

But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple's starting model, you'll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple's original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product. \\nIn a sense, this is Apple (AAPL) doing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones. \\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes, mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple's rivals. It's a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it's become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple's product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\\n Apple hasn't shared how many AirPods it's sold, but the company's wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it's hard not to believe it. \\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned, with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it's tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it's like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ. \\nFor those moments when you don't want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people's voices without sacrificing what you're listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual's ear canal's shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud. \\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it's still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem. \\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car. \\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I'd argue he's right.

Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \\nHere's what Paul said:\\n\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'\"\\nPaul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\\nWhile that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\\nWhat Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\\nThat's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\\nHere's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\\nThe task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\\nTo date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\\nFixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\\nBut thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\\nWhat Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\\nIt's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\\nTo which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\\n   \n",

Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\\nI asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\nCillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\\nBailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\\nBevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\\nGoforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.\\nAttorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\\nCillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\\nBailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\\nBut there are some clear differences between the two. \\nThe President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\\nBevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\\nCillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\\nBailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\\nAndy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\\nHe also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\\nCillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\\nBailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\\nBailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\\nThe President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\\nTrump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\\n   \n",

You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You're read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\\nThat response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\\nA bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\\nOn Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \\n\"If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!\".\\nAnd then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \\n\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\\nPresumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\\nWhich is fine! And smart!\\n(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\\nBut if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \\nThink of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\\nThat's not to say Trump's \"real\" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.\\nAnd honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\\nWhy haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\\nNo matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\\n   \n",

Hampshire and South Carolina as he fights to keep his campaign afloat, a Castro aide tells CNN.\\nThe teams in the two early nominating states were told they were being let go on Monday. Their last days at work will be next week, the aide said.\\nThis comes after CNN first reported on Saturday that the Castro campaign was looking to downsize, supporting staffers looking for other jobs and pivoting their focus to Iowa, Nevada and Texas.\\n\"In pushing to keep Secretary Castro's critical voice in this race, our campaign, like many others, will make adjustments in staffing and resources,\" Hackett said, in response to a story first reported by Politico. \"This race is shifting as we speak, and Julián will continue to be fearless and defy expectations by making the most of our resources.\"\\nSome Castro aides outside of New Hampshire and South Carolina have taken the campaign up on that offer and other campaigns have received inquiries from would-be former Castro aides.\\nAll of this is a bid to keep Castro's campaign solvent as the former Housing and Urban Development secretary works to qualify for the November debate, something he has yet to do.\\nCastro has struggled for months to raise money or get attention in the still large field of Democrats vying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.\\nBut the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.\\nCastro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.\\n   \n",

said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are \"legally invalid\" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.\\nThe guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.\\nImpeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.\\nIn the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\\nThe five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.\\nOLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\\nThe administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\\nThe memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\\n   \n",

Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\\n\"I say to tonight to the media: do your job and print his name,\" Paul, a Kentucky Republican, yelled during a rally Trump held in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin ahead of Tuesday's gubernatorial election. The crowd of Trump supporters, many donning \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT\" shirts, erupted into applause and cheers, and some chanted \"Do your job!\" and pointed toward the area where members of the press gathered to cover the event.\\nPaul told the crowd \"we also now know the name of the whistleblower,\" but did not provide any personal knowledge of the person's identity, before going on to echo baseless claims of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \"The whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,\" Paul said. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\nSeveral other Republicans have called for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator's insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\\nDuring the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\nThe anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\\nOn Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \\nZaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.\\nIn September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.\\nTwo sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\\n'Deeply troubling and disappointing' \\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.\\n\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,\" King said. \\n\"It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \\nLater on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\\nRaskin argued that the \"attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic\" that is a \"distraction from the merits of the case.\"\\n   \n",

But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \\nTalks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. \\nThat room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\\nAnd, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\\n\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\\nSenate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.\\nSchumer's office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House's impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.\\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\\nSchumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\\nA key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\\nThere is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections.

They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. \\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" He claimed that the \"many people\" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.\\nThen he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\\nBreaking down Trump's comments\\nHere is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \\n\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\\nGot that?\\nLet's break it down claim by claim.\\n1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.\\n2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\\n3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\\n4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\\nIn summary: Trump went from\\nA) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to\\nB) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\\nC) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \\nD) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\\nHe can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:\\nA fact check\\nAs Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" \\nThe Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call's aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\\nThe whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \\nThe White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \\nTrump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\\nIt was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\\n   \n",

Those dams are \"reviewed periodically\" and rated according to the age and condition of the dam, in addition to potential consequences. The federal agency's dams range from low to \"very high urgency of action.\"\\nIn the wake of Friday's announcement, the Corps also said that it is \"actively coordinating\" with partners and coordinating public outreach as part of interim risk-management strategies.\\n\"We're working closely with San Bernardino County, Apple Valley, Victorville, Hesperia and other downstream agencies to improve flood-risk awareness and emergency preparedness,\" said Kristen Bedolla, Dam Safety Program manager for the LA District. \"Community preparation also is a key component in reducing flood risk.â?\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nClaudia Cowan reports from Oroville\\nIn May, the Corps upgraded the risk characterization of Prado Dam to high urgency.

The girl was shot in the right side of her neck andÂ upper chest and remains in critical condition, and the man was shot in his left hand.\\nPolice said the man and the girl were not together and have no relationship. They said the man shot was not the intended target, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\\nThe teen, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, faces two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery through discharge of a firearm, according to a Friday release by Chicago police. Judge Joanne Rosado also told him he is charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, according to the Chicago Tribune.Â Heâ??ll be held in detention at least until a second hearing on Monday.\\nCALIFORNIA HALLOWEEN PARTY SHOOTING LEAVES AT LEAST 4 DEAD\\nThe shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. when threeÂ people walked up to another group of people in an alley in Chicagoâ??s Little Village neighborhood on the southwest side. Assistant stateâ??s attorney Jack Ruggiero told the court the boy and several others, at least one of whom was wearing a mask, went out that day â??looking for troubleâ? and looking for a Latin King (member of a Hispanic Chicago street gang). The shooting occurred close to the border dividing rival street gangs.\\nWhen they spotted the 32-year-old man on the otherÂ side of the alley as the little girl, one of them first tried to shake his hand. They informed him they were Gangster Two-Six members and then chased him, yelling â??Two-six!â? and â??King Killa!â? before the suspect fired seven times, hitting the man and the child.\\nAfter the shooting, the boy fled down another alley. The group listened to a police scanner and learned the little girl was shot. According to Ruggiero, the boy â??urinated on his handsâ? after learning about the girl to try to get the gunpowder off his hands. The boy told members of his group to â??hide the jacketâ? he was wearing.\\nRuggiero said police found the gun used in the attack after witnesses heard the boy say he tossed the gun in an alley near garbage cans and a school before he ran away. Video surveillance recorded him hiding the gun there.\\nThe suspect was arrested around 1:30 a.m. Friday.\\nâ??He transformed (the street) into a real-life horror movie,â? Ruggiero said. â??He showed complete disregard for human life,â? when he fired a gun seven times, Ruggiero added.\\nEVIDENCE IN MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER IS INSURMOUNTABLE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAYS\\n\"This minor didnâ??t care about the 7-year-old girl,'' Ruggiero said. He \"involved himself'' in a gang conflict.\\nThe boyâ??s defense attorney John Miraglia said in court the boy â??absolutelyâ? denies the charges. He said the boy has no â??publishableâ? background and said his parents are â??good people.â? His mother and stepfather appeared in court but gave no comment.\\nThe boyÂ spoke quietly during the hearing, mostly giving the judge yes or no answers. As Judge Rosado read the charges, he said â??I have a question,â? but the judge did not allow him to elaborate. The boy twisted around to look at his mother, who nodded several times at him as he was taken back into custody.\\nFamily members of the girl who was shot prayed outside Stroger hospital, where she was being cared for, Thursday night.Â â??The family of the 7-year-old girl who was shot in Little Village is grateful for the outpouring of love and support shown by all of Chicago and the nation. She remains in serious condition.

       "      <td>Talk radio host Dana Loesch argues 2020 White House hopeful Julian Castro is a 'hypocrite' on the subject after his remarks on gun control at the Democrat primary debate.\\nMANCHESTER, N.H. â?? Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro is laying off his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two of the first four early-voting states in the primary and caucus nominating season.\\nThe former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing secretary in then-President Barack Obamaâ??s cabinet will now focus his campaign on Iowa, which kicks off the nominating calendar, and Nevada, which votes third. The news â?? first reported by Politico â?? was confirmed early Tuesday by Fox News with a source close to the Castro campaign. The small staffs in both New Hampshire and South Carolina were notified on Monday.\\nCASTRO REACHES FUNDRAISING GOAL, STAYING IN 2020 RACE\\nThe move by the Castro campaign comes just a few days after it announced on Friday that it brought in $800,000 in the last 10 days of October, a haul Castro had said was necessary to continue his uphill bid for the Democratic nomination.\\nBut reaching that goal didnâ??t erase the steep fundraising hurdles facing the campaign. Castro, who launched his longshot bid last December, has frequently spotlighted his underdog status as he runs for the nomination against many much better-known and better-funded rivals.\\nCastro made the stage for the first four rounds of Democratic presidential primary debates, but has yet to qualify for the fifth round, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia. The candidate has reached the individual donor threshold but remains short of reaching the polling criteria.\\nIn a fundraising email on Monday, CastroÂ campaign officials warned that their candidate was in jeopardy of not making the debate stage and said that they were â??launching IMMEDIATE digital adsâ? to help them clinch â??the final polls Julian needs to qualify.â?\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\nCastro, the only Latino among the major Democratic White House hopefuls, will now pour his remaining resources into Iowa â?? where he launches a five-figure ad buy on Tuesday â?? and Nevada. Heâ??ll also concentrate on his native Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, directly after the early voting states. The other Texan in the nomination race,Â former Rep. Beto Oâ??Rourke,Â ended his White House bid on Friday. \\nCastro raised roughly $3.5 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, but spent nearly $4 million in the same period. Castro has just $670,000 cash on hand at the start of October, but raised $1 million last month.\\n\\n      Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro signs the famed wooden eggs as he headlines 'Politics and Eggs' at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, NH in January, 2019\\n      \\nEyebrows were raised in New Hampshire in recent days as Castroâ??s campaign had yet to schedule a date for their candidate to file in person to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. The source close to the campaign said it was unclear if Castro would file in person.\\nKAMALA HARRIS LAYS OFF STAFF, SHUTS OFFICES, IN NH\\nThe move by Castro follows a similar step made last week by Sen. Kamala Harris. The California Democrat, hemorrhaging campaign cash, dramatically cut her staff in New Hampshire and closed all of her field offices in the first primary state, as she continues to concentrate all of her resources on Iowa.\\n</td>\n",

The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky toÂ investigateÂ former Vice President Joe Biden and hisÂ son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\\nA transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\\nIn the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced â??evidence,â? such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaneyâ??s role in Trumpâ??s conversations with Zelensky.\\nâ??â?¦Bolton told a National Security Council staffer â??to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaneyâ??

The White Houseâ??s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\\nâ??We do that all the time with foreign policy,â? Mulvaney said. â??And I have news for everybody: Get over it. Thereâ??s going to be political influence in foreign policy.â?\\nMulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.\\nâ??Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trumpâ??s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the Presidentâ??s 2020 re-election campaign,â? they wrote.\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday.

Trump also appeared to suggest that he has information that a recent witness, Lt. Col. Â Alexander Vindman, is a â??Never-Trumper.â? He was asked about any evidence he may have about Vindman and he responded, Â â??Weâ??ll be showing that to you real soon.â?\\nVindman, who serves as a director on the National Security Council (NSC), testified last week in a closed-door hearing about his concerns about the presidentâ??s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr and a prior meeting with Ambassador Sondland about investigating Joe Biden and his son. A whistleblower's complaint about the phone call is at the center of House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry of the president. Trump has denied any wrongdoing suggested that the impeachment investigation is simply another attempt by Democrats to damage his presidency after the Mueller report fell short.

The surprise offer, made to Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, would allow Republicans to ask questions of the whistleblower without having to go through the committee's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\\nLate Sunday, House Oversight Committee ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, seemingly rejected the offer from whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, saying \"written answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross-examine the so-called whistleblower.\"\\nMeanwhile, Democrats reportedly are set to call in 11 witnesses to testify in private depositions this week, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former national security adviser John Bolton.

The committees have invited Bolton to appear Thursday but not issued a subpoena for his testimony. Bolton's lawyer has said he will not appear without a subpoena.\\nOmar backs Sanders in big way at rally, calls for end to 'Western imperialism' amid 'Lock him up!' chants\\nAmid repeated chants of \"Lock him up!\" and \"Green New Deal,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., issued a full-throated endorsement of Bernie Sanders at a spirited rally in Minneapolis' Williams Arena on Sunday night, saying a \"mass movement of the working class\" is needed to take down President Trump and end \"Western imperialism.\" \"I am excited for President Bernie Sanders!\" Omar thundered at the conclusion of her remarks, as rock music blared throughout the University of Minnesota venue.\\nAt no point did either Omar or Sanders attempt to stop attendees from shouting \"Lock him up\" whenever Trump was invoked.

       "      <td>President Trump's legacy in the judicial branch of the government is heading for a historic milestone. With several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees could soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench.\\nPresident Trump is on his way to reaching a significant mark in his presidency, asÂ his latest nominees for federal appeals courtsÂ go through the confirmation process.\\nWith several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees couldÂ soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench. Out of 179 Circuit Court positions, 43 are occupied by Trump picks, with four current vacancies and another five spots opening up due to upcoming retirements.\\nTRUMP JUDICIAL PICK BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AT HEARING OVER LEGAL GROUPâ??S ATTACK\\nâ??This is an exciting milestone for the president,â? Judicial Crisis Network policy director Carrie Severino told Fox News.\\nWhile a number of Trumpâ??s picks are filling seats previously held by judges appointed by Republican presidents, many are taking the place of liberal jurists appointed by Democrats. The Ninth Circuit, for example, once known as a staunchly liberal Court of Appeals, is gradually evening out. Trump has already placed six judges on the Ninth Circuit bench, which currently has one vacancy and will have two more in the near future.\\nShould Trump fill all three spots, he will have chosen nearly a third of the roster with nine out of 29 judges.\\nSeverino described Trumpâ??s appellate nominees as â??exceptional,â? while stressing their independence.\\nâ??Thatâ??s the kind of judge America wants,â? Severino said, claiming that the ability to select judges for lifetime positions is a significant part of why Trump was elected in 2016.\\nTRUMP NOMINATES WAVE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES, IN FRESH BID TO RESHAPE COURTS\\nDemocrats have been fierce in their opposition to several of Trumpâ??s selections. Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counselâ??s office.Â A segment on Rachel Maddowâ??s MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled \"Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy.\"Â Maddow cited Menashiâ??s use of the term â??ethnonationalismâ? to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on theÂ â??fringe of racial thinking.â?\\nDuring questioning, Sen.Â Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that MenashiÂ had faced â??unusually personalâ? and â??viciousâ? attacks.\\nMenashi denied the allegations, saying, â??Itâ??s hurtful and I think it misrepresents what Iâ??ve written.â?\\nDuring his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on â??constitutional traditions.\"\\nMenashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.\\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as â??Well Qualified,â? its highest mark.\\nThe ABAâ??s rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a â??Not Qualifiedâ? rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\\nThe ABAâ??s letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigantsÂ and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had runÂ against VanDyke for a judicial position.\\nAdditionally, multiple people who were interviewed by the ABA for VanDykeâ??s evaluation told Fox News that they gave positive reviews and were surprised by the ABAâ??s findings.\\nAddressing the accusations in the ABAâ??s letter, specifically his supposed stance towards the LGBTQ community, VanDyke broke down in tears in the middle of his hearing, denying the allegation.\\nâ??No, I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God. They should all be treated with dignity and respect,â? he said.\\nDespite opposition from the left, Trumpâ??s picks are likely to be confirmed due to the Senateâ??s Republican majority. \\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nMike Davis, president of The Article III Project, which works to help secure the confirmation of Trumpâ??s picks, noted that the presidentâ??s success in this area fulfills one of his 2016 campaign promises.\\nâ??President Trump has delivered on his promise to American voters,â? Davis said, pointing to Trumpâ??s appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, â??and an all-time-record number of circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals.â?\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Even Democrats are taking notice of the estimated price tag. Dr. Vin Gupta weighs in.\\nAs \"Medicare-for-all\" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary,Â a new report released by the British government on itsÂ National Health Service, or NHS,Â offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.\\nThe reportÂ on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, detailsÂ increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visitsÂ to cancer care.Â And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.\\n\"Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,\" the report also declares.\\nAn American \"Medicare-for-all\" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system.Â Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.\\nBut the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range ofÂ Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth WarrenÂ haveÂ captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.\\nCritics in the United States have saidÂ that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.\\n\"Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'\" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday.Â \"Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.'Â But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?\\n\"Thereâ??s a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren wonâ??t admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.\"\\nThe reportÂ on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standardsÂ in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.\\n\"In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,\" the report says of cancer wait times. \"During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded. The target of 85% has been missed for all but one month since April 2014.\"\\n\\n      A chart from the British House of Commons shows increased wait times for \"accident and emergency\" care in English hospitals over time.\\n      (House of Commons)\\nWARREN UNDER FIRE ON 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' AS SHE NOW CLAIMS BILLIONAIRES ALONE CAN FUND IT\\nPatients whose general practitioner refers them to a consultant, the report continues, are also waiting longer.\\nWhile the report is largely negative, it notes some positive indicators -- including an increase in the number of doctors and nurses in recent years.\\nThe British NHS provides health care for all for no cost at the point of delivery, which isÂ similar to what Sanders and Warren aim for with \"Medicare-for-all.\" It is funded through general taxation, meaning every taxpayer chips in to fund the program.\\n\\n      A surgical team prepare a patient ahead of performing an operation at Milton Keynes University Hospital in Milton Keynes, central England, Britain, May 23, 2018. A recent report shows England's NHS system is failing to meet several of its standards regarding patient wait times.\\n      (REUTERS)\\nFUNDING FOR 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' WITH TAXES ON THE RICH 'IMPOSSIBLE,' STUDY SAYS\\nAs Fox News first reported, Warren on Friday outlined a plan costing $52 trillion over the next decade, includingÂ $20 trillion in new spending -- covered largelyÂ by an array of taxes on corporations, the wealthy and employers in general.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nA report from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released a report last week that said it would be \"impossible\" to fund such a plan with only taxes on the wealthy.\\nFox News' Adam Shaw and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.Â \\n</td>\n",

OneÂ child is currently missing, and authorities are searching the mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border for the child.\\nThose attacked were members of the LeBaron family, a well-known American clan who hasÂ lived in the community in the northern part of the country for decades, according toÂ The New York Times.Â The attack targeted citizens who live in a community founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\n\"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,\" Trump tweeted. \"We merely await a call from your great new president!\"\\nPresident AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador refused that approach, however, saying at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\"\\n\"We declared war, and it didn't work,\" Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. \"That is not an option.\"\\nTrump has repeatedly raised concerns about levels of gang violence and drug-related crime in Mexico, particularly as it relates to securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The two countries have stepped up cooperation on that front over the summer, with asylum seekers being returned to Mexico to await hearings, while Mexico has also increased its troop presence on both its northern and southern borders.\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nEarly reports indicated the tragedy could have been a case of mistaken identity, but recent history also raises the possibility the LeBaron family was the intended target: only a decade ago, two members of the family opposed to local drug trafficking groups were kidnapped and murdered, according to the New York Times.\\nMexico's federal Department of Security and Citizens' Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area following \"the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people.\" The troops were searching for the missing community members, believed to include 11 children or more.\\nA number of Republicans backed Trump's call for action in Mexico in response to the massacre. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said that Mexico is \"dangerously closeÂ to being a failed state.\"\\n\"This is what happens when Mexicoâ??s politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power. Enough. Mexicoâ??s president hasnâ??t taken the threat seriously and innocent American lives have been lost again. The Mexican government must partner with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to wage a full-scale offensive against these butchers,â? he said.\\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose own father was born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, also extended his condolences for the victims and called for the U.S. to get involved.\\nâ??Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy.

Tuesday will decide whether to make the liberal enclave Arizona's only sanctuary city in a rebuke to President Trumpâ??s immigration policies and a tough state anti-illegal immigration law that drew international condemnation nearly a decade ago. \\nThe measure, Proposition 205, would put new restrictions on when police can inquire about immigration status or cooperate with federal law enforcement.\\n\\n      Tucson voters will decide Tuesday whether to declare itself a sanctuary city.Â \\n      (tucsonaz.gov)\\nTucson progressives say the measure will send a clear message to the Trump administration and give a voice to the city's sizable Latino community. \\nThe measure explicitly aims to neuter SB1070, a 2010 Arizona immigration law that drew mass protests and a boycott of Arizona. SB1070 prohibits sanctuary cities in Arizona and requires police to verify the immigration status of anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant. Courts threw out much of the law but upheld the requirement for officers to check immigration papers. \\nCALIFORNIA SHERIFF BLASTS â??FOLKS IN SACRAMENTOâ?? AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ALLEGEDLY SHOOTS DEPUTY, SPARKS CHASE\\nTucson's mayor and city council members â?? all Democrats â?? oppose Proposition 205Â because they're concerned the city could lose millions of federal and state funds, which make up a chunk of the Tucson's budget. They say police have already adopted rules that go as far as legally possible to restrict officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \\nA handful of Republican state lawmakers have said they will pursue legislation to punish Tucson. Prior legislation approved by the GOP Legislature to tie the hands of liberal cities allows the state to cut off funding for cities that pass laws conflicting with state laws.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n   \n",

Kamala Harris of California.\\nSteyerâ??s campaign confirmed on Monday evening that Dwane Sims, the billionaire candidateâ??s deputy South Carolina state director, offered his resignation following an internal investigation into the allegationsÂ that he stole the data of thousands of contacts from the Harris campaign. \\nâ??Last week, the South Carolina Democratic Party turned off voter file access to the Steyer campaign for a short period of time. When it was reinstated, Dwane Sims, a former South Carolina Democratic Party employee, had access to other presidential campaign data,â? Heather Hargreaves, Steyerâ??s campaign manager, said in a statement. â??When we first learned about the matter, we conducted an internal investigation and wiped Mr. Simsâ?? computer to make sure the data was completely deleted and that there was no access to other campaign data.â?\\nDAVID AVELLA: TOM STEYER IS BIDEN'S BIGGEST THREAT\\nShe added: â??We understand the sensitivity and importance of this information. We apologize to the South Carolina Democratic Party and the DNC. Tom Steyer and the Steyer campaign extend our deepest apology to Senator Kamala Harris and her campaign.â?\\nThe Steyer campaign noted that the South Carolina Democratic Party had turned off access for a short time last week to voter files and when it was reinstated Sims â?? as a former employee of the state party â?? had access to information on other presidential candidates' data. Sims called the SCDP â??[w]ithin minutes of realizing thisâ? and access was disabled, according to Steyerâ??s campaign.\\nBut inÂ a story first reported by The Post and Courier of Charleston, officials from the SCDP and the Democratic National Committee said they actually intervened in Sims' attempt to export the data, which included thousands of voter contacts built up by Harris' campaign.\\n\"Our organizers and volunteers work incredibly hard, and as this story notes, our campaign â??has built a particularly extensive field organizing operation in South Carolina,â??â? Ian Sams, the Harris campaignâ??s national press secretary, said in a tweet. â??It's unfortunate anyone would try to steal that work from our team.\"\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nSims was announced last month as Steyer's deputy state director in South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South. A month earlier, Sims had been working as data director for the South Carolina Democratic Party, a role in which he had access to proprietary campaign information.\\nA recent poll by The Post and Courier has Steyer polling at 5 percent, compared with Harris at 11 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden still holds a commanding lead in Palmetto State with 30 percent. \\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n   \n",

Aaron Barta, commander of the Corpsâ?? Los Angeles District, said in a statement. â??This is a storm that is unlikely to occur, but it is nonetheless a real possibility and one we must be prepared for.\"\\nCALIFORNIA POLICE RIP DRONE PILOT AS DEVICE GETS IN WAY OF WILDFIRE RELIEF EFFORTS\\nThe earthen dam was built in 1971 near the San Bernardino Mountains, and was \"designed and constructed consistent with the standards of the day,\" according to federal officials.\\n\\n      The Mojave River Dam, pictured in this undated photo, was built in the 1970s near the San Bernardino Mountains. Officials said Friday the dam could fail during an extreme storm, causing flooding in Mojave Desert communities.\\n      (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)\\n\"It continues to operate as it was designed and reduces risk for more than 16,000 people and $1.5 billion in property,\" the agency said.\\nThe 200-foot dam has never been breached, but an assessment done in 2018 found that during an extreme storm, water could flow over the top of the structure, causing it to erode and potentially fail.Â If the dam were to fail, it would threaten the communities of Hesperia, Apple Valley, Victorville and Barstow, located adjacent to the Mojave River that is home to about 300,000 people.\\nA potential dam failure could generate flooding that could even impact the town of Baker, located more than 140 miles downriver.\\nLuciano Vera, a spokesman for the Los Angeles district of the Army Corps of Engineers, told the Associated Press that the chances of a storm that could overtop the dam are small, about 1-in-10,000.\\nBut Vera added just because chances are small doesn't minimalize the threat.\\nInsight from Mark Ogden, project manager for the Association of State Dam Safety Officials\\n\"All it takes is one event...one Katrina, one Hurricane Harvey,â? Vera told the AP. â??These storms are happening more and more, so this is our way of looking toward the future.â?\\nCALIFORNIA GOVERNOR PLEADS WITH RESIDENTS TO STOP TARGETING UTILITY WORKERS\\nThe Army Corps said in a news release it is evaluating interim risk-reduction measures associated with a potential overtopping of the dam and anticipates that some of those measures will be in place ahead of this year's winter rains.Â The Army Corps has been looking at all of its 700 dams nationwide in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devastation in 2005.\\nThe Army Corp's LA District owns and operates 17 dams across California, Arizona and Nevada that reduce the risk of flooding for about 7 million people and $200 billion in the property. Those dams are \"reviewed periodically\" and rated according to the age and condition of the dam, in addition to potential consequences. The federal agency's dams range from low to \"very high urgency of action.\"\\nIn the wake of Friday's announcement, the Corps also said that it is \"actively coordinating\" with partners and coordinating public outreach as part of interim risk-management strategies.\\n\"We're working closely with San Bernardino County, Apple Valley, Victorville, Hesperia and other downstream agencies to improve flood-risk awareness and emergency preparedness,\" said Kristen Bedolla, Dam Safety Program manager for the LA District. \"Community preparation also is a key component in reducing flood risk.â?\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nClaudia Cowan reports from Oroville\\nIn May, the Corps upgraded the risk characterization of Prado Dam to high urgency. That dam is located on the Santa Ana River in the Los Angeles suburb of Corona. Dozens of Southern California cities with about 1.4 million people live downstream. Work to improve the dam has been underway since 2002 to increase the amount of floodwaters and sediment it can store.\\nIn 2017, some 200,000 people in three Sierra Nevada counties in Northern CaliforniaÂ were forced to evacuate after spillways at the Oroville Dam crumbled and fell away during heavy rains.\\nFlooding didnâ??t happen, however, and the dam and associated spillways have since been repaired.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n   \n",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\\nA 15-year-old boy appeared in court Saturday on attempted murder charges for allegedly shooting a 7-year-old girl while she was out trick-or-treating.\\nChicago police identified the suspect in the Halloween shooting of the girl, who was dressed a bumblebee andÂ out collecting candy, and a 32-year-old man. The girl was shot in the right side of her neck andÂ upper chest and remains in critical condition, and the man was shot in his left hand.\\nPolice said the man and the girl were not together and have no relationship. They said the man shot was not the intended target, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\\nThe teen, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, faces two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery through discharge of a firearm, according to a Friday release by Chicago police. Judge Joanne Rosado also told him he is charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, according to the Chicago Tribune.Â Heâ??ll be held in detention at least until a second hearing on Monday.\\nCALIFORNIA HALLOWEEN PARTY SHOOTING LEAVES AT LEAST 4 DEAD\\nThe shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. when threeÂ people walked up to another group of people in an alley in Chicagoâ??s Little Village neighborhood on the southwest side. Assistant stateâ??s attorney Jack Ruggiero told the court the boy and several others, at least one of whom was wearing a mask, went out that day â??looking for troubleâ? and looking for a Latin King (member of a Hispanic Chicago street gang). The shooting occurred close to the border dividing rival street gangs.\\nWhen they spotted the 32-year-old man on the otherÂ side of the alley as the little girl, one of them first tried to shake his hand. They informed him they were Gangster Two-Six members and then chased him, yelling â??Two-six!â? and â??King Killa!â? before the suspect fired seven times, hitting the man and the child.\\nAfter the shooting, the boy fled down another alley. The group listened to a police scanner and learned the little girl was shot. According to Ruggiero, the boy â??urinated on his handsâ? after learning about the girl to try to get the gunpowder off his hands. The boy told members of his group to â??hide the jacketâ? he was wearing.\\nRuggiero said police found the gun used in the attack after witnesses heard the boy say he tossed the gun in an alley near garbage cans and a school before he ran away. Video surveillance recorded him hiding the gun there.\\nThe suspect was arrested around 1:30 a.m. Friday.\\nâ??He transformed (the street) into a real-life horror movie,â? Ruggiero said. â??He showed complete disregard for human life,â? when he fired a gun seven times, Ruggiero added.\\nEVIDENCE IN MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER IS INSURMOUNTABLE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAYS\\n\"This minor didnâ??t care about the 7-year-old girl,'' Ruggiero said. He \"involved himself'' in a gang conflict.\\nThe boyâ??s defense attorney John Miraglia said in court the boy â??absolutelyâ? denies the charges. He said the boy has no â??publishableâ? background and said his parents are â??good people.â? His mother and stepfather appeared in court but gave no comment.\\nThe boyÂ spoke quietly during the hearing, mostly giving the judge yes or no answers. As Judge Rosado read the charges, he said â??I have a question,â? but the judge did not allow him to elaborate. The boy twisted around to look at his mother, who nodded several times at him as he was taken back into custody.\\nFamily members of the girl who was shot prayed outside Stroger hospital, where she was being cared for, Thursday night.Â â??The family of the 7-year-old girl who was shot in Little Village is grateful for the outpouring of love and support shown by all of Chicago and the nation. She remains in serious condition. At this time, the family is requesting privacy,â? a Cook County health department statement said.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nLocal resident Jose Vazquez told the Sun-Times the sceneÂ of the attack has been a hotbed for violence. \"That alley is crazy,â? he said.\\n   \n",

Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro is laying off his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two of the first four early-voting states in the primary and caucus nominating season.\\nThe former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing secretary in then-President Barack Obamaâ??s cabinet will now focus his campaign on Iowa, which kicks off the nominating calendar, and Nevada, which votes third. The news â?? first reported by Politico â?? was confirmed early Tuesday by Fox News with a source close to the Castro campaign. The small staffs in both New Hampshire and South Carolina were notified on Monday.\\nCASTRO REACHES FUNDRAISING GOAL, STAYING IN 2020 RACE\\nThe move by the Castro campaign comes just a few days after it announced on Friday that it brought in $800,000 in the last 10 days of October, a haul Castro had said was necessary to continue his uphill bid for the Democratic nomination.\\nBut reaching that goal didnâ??t erase the steep fundraising hurdles facing the campaign. Castro, who launched his longshot bid last December, has frequently spotlighted his underdog status as he runs for the nomination against many much better-known and better-funded rivals.\\nCastro made the stage for the first four rounds of Democratic presidential primary debates, but has yet to qualify for the fifth round, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia. The candidate has reached the individual donor threshold but remains short of reaching the polling criteria.\\nIn a fundraising email on Monday, CastroÂ campaign officials warned that their candidate was in jeopardy of not making the debate stage and said that they were â??launching IMMEDIATE digital adsâ? to help them clinch â??the final polls Julian needs to qualify.â?\\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\\nCastro, the only Latino among the major Democratic White House hopefuls, will now pour his remaining resources into Iowa â?? where he launches a five-figure ad buy on Tuesday â?? and Nevada. Heâ??ll also concentrate on his native Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, directly after the early voting states. The other Texan in the nomination race,Â former Rep. Beto Oâ??Rourke,Â ended his White House bid on Friday. \\nCastro raised roughly $3.5 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, but spent nearly $4 million in the same period. Castro has just $670,000 cash on hand at the start of October, but raised $1 million last month.\\n\\n      Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro signs the famed wooden eggs as he headlines 'Politics and Eggs' at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, NH in January, 2019\\n      \\nEyebrows were raised in New Hampshire in recent days as Castroâ??s campaign had yet to schedule a date for their candidate to file in person to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. The source close to the campaign said it was unclear if Castro would file in person.\\nKAMALA HARRIS LAYS OFF STAFF, SHUTS OFFICES, IN NH\\nThe move by Castro follows a similar step made last week by Sen. Kamala Harris. The California Democrat, hemorrhaging campaign cash, dramatically cut her staff in New Hampshire and closed all of her field offices in the first primary state, as she continues to concentrate all of her resources on Iowa.\\n   \n",

The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky toÂ investigateÂ former Vice President Joe Biden and hisÂ son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\\nA transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any \"quid pro quo.\" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.\\nIn the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced â??evidence,â? such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaneyâ??s role in Trumpâ??s conversations with Zelensky.\\nâ??â?¦Bolton told a National Security Council staffer â??to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaneyâ?? Â to pressure Ukraine for political help,â? they wrote.\\nâ??Ambassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the Presidentâ??s scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, â??I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,â??â? they wrote. â??The â??drug dealâ?? appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.â?\\nThe chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing â??a central roleâ? in the presidentâ??s move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.\\nâ??You admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the Presidentâ??s own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,â? they wrote.\\nDuring a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White Houseâ??s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.\\nâ??We do that all the time with foreign policy,â? Mulvaney said. â??And I have news for everybody: Get over it. Thereâ??s going to be political influence in foreign policy.â?\\nMulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a \"quid pro quo,\" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.\\nâ??Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trumpâ??s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the Presidentâ??s 2020 re-election campaign,â? they wrote.\\nIt is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\\nFox News' Chad Pergram and John Roberts contributed to this report.Â \\n   \n",

With several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees could soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench.\\nPresident Trump is on his way to reaching a significant mark in his presidency, asÂ his latest nominees for federal appeals courtsÂ go through the confirmation process.\\nWith several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees couldÂ soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench. Out of 179 Circuit Court positions, 43 are occupied by Trump picks, with four current vacancies and another five spots opening up due to upcoming retirements.\\nTRUMP JUDICIAL PICK BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AT HEARING OVER LEGAL GROUPâ??S ATTACK\\nâ??This is an exciting milestone for the president,â? Judicial Crisis Network policy director Carrie Severino told Fox News.\\nWhile a number of Trumpâ??s picks are filling seats previously held by judges appointed by Republican presidents, many are taking the place of liberal jurists appointed by Democrats. The Ninth Circuit, for example, once known as a staunchly liberal Court of Appeals, is gradually evening out. Trump has already placed six judges on the Ninth Circuit bench, which currently has one vacancy and will have two more in the near future.\\nShould Trump fill all three spots, he will have chosen nearly a third of the roster with nine out of 29 judges.\\nSeverino described Trumpâ??s appellate nominees as â??exceptional,â? while stressing their independence.\\nâ??Thatâ??s the kind of judge America wants,â? Severino said, claiming that the ability to select judges for lifetime positions is a significant part of why Trump was elected in 2016.\\nTRUMP NOMINATES WAVE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES, IN FRESH BID TO RESHAPE COURTS\\nDemocrats have been fierce in their opposition to several of Trumpâ??s selections. Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counselâ??s office.Â A segment on Rachel Maddowâ??s MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled \"Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy.\"Â Maddow cited Menashiâ??s use of the term â??ethnonationalismâ? to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on theÂ â??fringe of racial thinking.â?\\nDuring questioning, Sen.Â Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that MenashiÂ had faced â??unusually personalâ? and â??viciousâ? attacks.\\nMenashi denied the allegations, saying, â??Itâ??s hurtful and I think it misrepresents what Iâ??ve written.â?\\nDuring his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on â??constitutional traditions.\"\\nMenashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.\\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as â??Well Qualified,â? its highest mark.\\nThe ABAâ??s rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a â??Not Qualifiedâ? rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.\\nThe ABAâ??s letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigantsÂ and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had runÂ against VanDyke for a judicial position.\\nAdditionally, multiple people who were interviewed by the ABA for VanDykeâ??s evaluation told Fox News that they gave positive reviews and were surprised by the ABAâ??s findings.\\nAddressing the accusations in the ABAâ??s letter, specifically his supposed stance towards the LGBTQ community, VanDyke broke down in tears in the middle of his hearing, denying the allegation.\\nâ??No, I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God. They should all be treated with dignity and respect,â? he said.\\nDespite opposition from the left, Trumpâ??s picks are likely to be confirmed due to the Senateâ??s Republican majority. \\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nMike Davis, president of The Article III Project, which works to help secure the confirmation of Trumpâ??s picks, noted that the presidentâ??s success in this area fulfills one of his 2016 campaign promises.\\nâ??President Trump has delivered on his promise to American voters,â? Davis said, pointing to Trumpâ??s appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, â??and an all-time-record number of circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals.â?\\n   \n",

Dr. Vin Gupta weighs in.\\nAs \"Medicare-for-all\" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary,Â a new report released by the British government on itsÂ National Health Service, or NHS,Â offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.\\nThe reportÂ on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, detailsÂ increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visitsÂ to cancer care.Â And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.\\n\"Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,\" the report also declares.\\nAn American \"Medicare-for-all\" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system.Â Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the \"Medicare-for-all\" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.\\nBut the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range ofÂ Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth WarrenÂ haveÂ captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.\\nCritics in the United States have saidÂ that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.\\n\"Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'\" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday.Â \"Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.'Â But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?\\n\"Thereâ??s a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren wonâ??t admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.\"\\nThe reportÂ on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standardsÂ in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.\\n\"In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,\" the report says of cancer wait times. \"During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded.

OneÂ child is currently missing, and authorities are searching the mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border for the child.\\nThose attacked were members of the LeBaron family, a well-known American clan who hasÂ lived in the community in the northern part of the country for decades, according toÂ The New York Times.Â The attack targeted citizens who live in a community founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\n\"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,\" Trump tweeted. \"We merely await a call from your great new president!\"\\nPresident AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador refused that approach, however, saying at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\"\\n\"We declared war, and it didn't work,\" Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. \"That is not an option.\"\\nTrump has repeatedly raised concerns about levels of gang violence and drug-related crime in Mexico, particularly as it relates to securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The two countries have stepped up cooperation on that front over the summer, with asylum seekers being returned to Mexico to await hearings, while Mexico has also increased its troop presence on both its northern and southern borders.\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\nEarly reports indicated the tragedy could have been a case of mistaken identity, but recent history also raises the possibility the LeBaron family was the intended target: only a decade ago, two members of the family opposed to local drug trafficking groups were kidnapped and murdered, according to the New York Times.\\nMexico's federal Department of Security and Citizens' Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area following \"the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people.\" The troops were searching for the missing community members, believed to include 11 children or more.\\nA number of Republicans backed Trump's call for action in Mexico in response to the massacre. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said that Mexico is \"dangerously closeÂ to being a failed state.\"\\n\"This is what happens when Mexicoâ??s politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power. Enough. Mexicoâ??s president hasnâ??t taken the threat seriously and innocent American lives have been lost again. The Mexican government must partner with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to wage a full-scale offensive against these butchers,â? he said.\\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose own father was born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, also extended his condolences for the victims and called for the U.S. to get involved.\\nâ??Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence,â? he tweeted.\\nFox Newsâ??

       "      <td>(CNN)A former Georgia police officer was sentenced to 12 years in prison Friday for the killing of  a mentally ill, unarmed and naked black man in 2015.  \\nDeKalb County Superior Court Judge LaTisha Dear Jackson gave Robert \"Chip\" Olsen a 20-year term, with 12 years to be served in custody. Under the sentence, Olsen is prohibited from working in law enforcement, possessing firearms or profiting from the case. \\nDear Jackson praised what she said was the strength, fortitude and compassion of the family of the victim, 26-year-old Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. She said she had also watched the defendant closely during the trial. \\n\"Many might have thought you were stoic and void of emotion,\" the judge told Olsen. \"From the time opening statements started, I saw the tears that you've had. I saw how you replayed March 9, 2015, in your head.\" \\nProsecutors had asked the court for a 25-year sentence with five years probation. \\nA jury last month acquitted Olsen of murder in the March 2015 death of Hill but found him guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath.\\nJurors deliberated for more than a week. Olsen had faced up to 35 years in prison.\\nBefore sentencing, the court heard from Hill's mother, father and sister.\\n\"The decision Robert Olsen made that day changed my life forever,\" said his mother, Carolyn Baylor Giummo. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\\nShe remembered her son as a compassionate child, a talented choir singer and student-athlete whose life seemed to change after his deployment to Afghanistan.   \\n\"He didn't come back unscathed,\" she said. At the time of the shooting, Hill had had stopped taking his medications because of side effects and suffered a breakdown, she said. \\nGiummo recalled her father always telling her and his grandchildren that \"if you're ever in trouble, run to the police.\"\\n\"The jury may have found Mr. Robert Olsen not guilty of murder but he still killed my son,\" she told the court. \"He has never taken responsibility for taking my son's life. He's never just said, 'I'm sorry for killing Tony.'\"\\n Anthony Hill, Sr., said he felt as if he had failed as a father for not protecting his son. He lamented that the defendant never once looked him in the eye with an expression of remorse. \\n\"I stood out in that passageway many a day just hoping to make a little bit of eye contact,\" he said. \"Not one time would he look my way.\"\\nOlsen's wife, Catherine, read a statement in court. She said one of the few times she saw her husband break down emotionally was after he killed Hill. \\n\"He was mourning for the individual whose life he had taken,\" she said, adding that she and Olsen recognize the pain of Hill's family. \\n\"I cannot imagine how hard this had been for his parents and family,\" she said.  \\nCatherine Olsen was overcome by emotion as her husband was taken away by officers after the sentencing.\\nOlsen did not address the court.\\nBefore the shooting, someone in Hill's neighborhood called police to report a man was \"acting deranged, knocking on doors, and crawling around on the ground naked,\" then-DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said then.\\nOlsen was dispatched, and \"when (Hill) saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer. The officer called him to stop while stepping backwards, drew his weapon and fired two shots,\" Alexander said.\\nDefense attorney Amanda Clark Palmer said Olsen, who worked for the DeKalb County police, was \"a good cop who had to make a tough decision.\"\\nHill's girlfriend previously said he had a history of mental illness and struggled to get the support he needed from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had stopped taking his medication shortly before his death, she said. \\nDuring closing arguments, the prosecution claimed Olsen did not follow protocol for using force. Assistant District Attorney Lance Cross said Olsen could have used a baton on Hill.\\n</td>\n",

Connery got out of his car after it got stuck when the shoulder of the road collapsed, Kopy said. He lost his footing and was swept away, New York State Police said in a release.\\nConnery, who had served for 56 years and lived about 60 miles away in Glenville, planned to spend the night in the rectory and lead the All Saints Day mass in Newport on Friday morning, Deacon Jim Bower of the Holy Family Parish in Hicksville, told CNN. \\n\"It's always a tragedy when anyone passes away and I think we always take it harder when its someone that we know and have a great deal of respect and love for,\" Bower said.\\nBishop Edward B.

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)The winner of Mississippi's gubernatorial election Tuesday will not only have to capture the state's popular vote, but will also have to prevail in the state's unique election process for electing a governor and other statewide officials that was established during the Jim Crow era. \\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state's popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as \"leans Republican\" -- the state's unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. \\nA candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nThe election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \\nCritics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\\nThe provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\\nWhile Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)Mary Kerrie Davis had smoked cigarettes for most of her adult life, when she embraced vaping as a way to quit.\\nFor several years, the 52-year-old mother from Georgia vaped only nicotine. But after trying THC cartridges, she began to experience health problems. On September 6, she died.\\nMary Kerrie's case sounds like the nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related injury confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of this week, the outbreak has led to 37 vaping-related deaths in 24 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands.\\nMany of those cases and deaths were among people who vaped THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.\\n\"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters in October. \"But I'd like to stress that we don't know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or way that the devices are producing harm.\"\\nMary Kerrie's death hasn't yet been counted in the CDC's total. Her grieving family has many questions still without answers. But they believe that vaping THC is what ultimately led to her death.\\nFrom smoking to vaping\\nWhen Mary Kerrie transitioned to vaping nicotine a few years ago, she stopped smoking cigarettes completely, her daughter, Maggie Davis, said. Mary Kerrie was adamant with family and friends that vaping was healthier than smoking.\\n\"She thought it was safer,\" her husband, Kevin Davis, said. \"I certainly liked the fact that there wasn't the cigarette smell and her breath didn't smell like cigarettes. I kind of thought it was better, too.\"\\nMaggie remembers that her mom came to California this summer to help her move into her dorm for her senior year of college. While there, Mary Kerrie went to a vape shop and purchased THC cartridges for the first time.\\nImmediately upon returning home, she developed a nagging cough. Kevin didn't know Mary Kerrie had been vaping THC cartridges. Only after her death did the Davis family learn that Mary Kerrie had continued buying and using THC cartridges in Georgia. Unlike in California, THC is illegal in the Davis' home state.\\n'I hope you don't have that vaping disease'\\nMary Kerrie experienced a steady decline in health between the time she started vaping THC cartridges and her death. The initial health effects she had experienced from vaping to quit smoking transitioned into frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a terrible cough. They're all among the reported symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\nMary Kerrie went to the hospital for assessment on September 4. A flu swab tested negative. She texted her daughter that she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nMaggie had just begun hearing reports of a national outbreak of a mystery illness related to vaping. She texted her mom, \"I hope you don't have that vaping disease.\"\\nOn the way home from the hospital, groaning between coughs, Mary Kerrie said, \"I'm never smoking again. I'm throwing out all of my e-cigarettes and weed pens,\" Maggie wrote in a personal essay for her college newspaper.\\nKevin, an OB/GYN, encouraged Mary Kerrie when she declared she was quitting it all.\\nStill, Mary Kerrie's symptoms became worse over the next two days. She stayed home from social gatherings, telling her husband that she just needed rest.\\nHe felt she should be seen again by a doctor.\\nDays later, on September 6, Mary Kerrie was still sick. It was Kevin who found her, lips blue and gasping for breath, whispering, \"help.\"\\nOn the way to the hospital again, Mary Kerrie's pulse was barely detectable. She'd become unresponsive.\\nAt the hospital, doctors performed CPR unsuccessfully.\\nMoments later, Mary Kerrie -- an outgoing 52-year-old who loved rollerskating and mountain biking, a mother and wife who was known for being vivacious and happy -- was gone.\\n\"She will never see her youngest daughter graduate high school, nor her oldest graduate college,\" Maggie wrote after her death. \"She will never see her daughters married or meet her grandchildren. Her absence, a sudden and jarring hole in my family, will be felt for decades to come.\"\\nIn X-rays on the day Mary Kerrie presented at the hospital, her lungs had looked clear. Two days later, they revealed a white substance resembling clouds infiltrating Mary Kerrie's lungs.\\n'From healthy to drowning in your own lungs'\\nTo the Davis family, the X-rays seemed to confirm what they had heard in the news: Mary Kerrie's illness wasn't simply a case of pneumonia. In addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain, the whiteout in her lungs was one of the symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\n\"This wasn't a nursing home patient. This wasn't somebody with a chronic illness,\" Kevin said. \"You don't just go from healthy to drowning in your own lungs and a flatline EKG from things in your daily life.\"\\nNearly two months after Mary Kerrie's death, her case is still not part of the official CDC count of vaping-related lung injury deaths.\\nIn part, it speaks to just how new of a phenomenon this is. The ongoing investigation \"may take a few months\" and could yield \"multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\" CDC's Schuchat told reporters early in October.\\nFor the Davis family, the wait has been frustrating. To them, it seems obvious that Mary Kerrie's death is related to vaping.\\nKevin said he recently spoke with a CDC official who said that his wife's case met the agency's definition of a vaping-related illness, but the agency is waiting for the county medical examiner's decision before making an announcement.\\nThere have already been three confirmed vaping-related deaths in Georgia. If and when it is announced, Mary Kerrie's death could be the fourth, potentially making Georgia's death count the highest in the United States.\\nMary Kerrie's legacy\\nThe Davis family and Mary Kerrie's friends want her to be remembered for the good she brought into their lives.\\n\"She was all in on me and all in on our daughters, all in on her family. Anything that she wanted to be a part of, it was everything for her,\" Kevin said of their 24-year marriage. \"Her energy is beautiful, and I sure miss her.\"\\nThe Davis family attributes part of the blame for Mary Kerrie's death to a lack of regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration.\\n\"Marijuana pens also boast exponentially higher numbers of THC, and yet we still do not know how this historically disproportionate consumption of marijuana affects the human body, particularly when consumed as an oil,\" Maggie wrote.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA warned consumers to stop using THC vaping products as investigations into vaping-related lung injuries and deaths continue. Last week, the CDC made a similar warning, saying \"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC.\"\\n\"Mary Kerrie vaped [nicotine] products for several years I would say, successfully, and did quit smoking,\" Kevin said. \"I think when she was exposed to legal THC in California and then got illicit THC in Georgia ... I think that's what killed her.\"\\n\"Other people, if they're being exposed to something that can kill them, I hope they stop,\" Kevin said. \"I hope her passing helps somebody else.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York  (CNN Business)Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash pile keeps expanding, but Warren Buffett's industrial and insurance conglomerate has yet to make a major acquisition to ramp up growth.\\nBerkshire on Saturday reported it has $128 billion in cash, up from $122 billion in the second quarter.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has lagged the market this year, and Buffett has said that he wants to make an \"elephant\" sized acquisition with the company's mountain of cash. The problem is that the market rally has made any potential targets much more expensive, and Buffett has said he doesn't want to overspend on deals.\\nBerkshire's operating profit rose to $7.9 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year earlier, boosted by gains across its holdings. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's performance is tied to its many subsidiaries -- which include GEICO, railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe and consumer brands like Duracell, Dairy Queen and paint maker Benjamin Moore -- as well as a massive investment portfolio.\\nBerkshire also said tariffs from the US-China trade war weighed on its consumer and industrial businesses. The tariffs cut into sales of Precision Castparts, it gas turbine and pipe products unit, the filings said. BNSF railroad saw a 5% profit gain due to cost-cutting measures to offset a drag from trade tensions.\\nWhile Berkshire has yet to make a major acquisition, the company has been taking steps to embrace more reasonably valued tech stocks in recent years. Berkshire Hathaway still owns large stakes in value stalwarts like Coke, (KO) Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX) and Kraft Heinz, (KHC) which has taken billions of dollars in writedowns this year on some of its top brands.\\nBut the company's biggest holding now is Apple (AAPL), and Berkshire even has a small stake in Amazon (AMZN).\\nBerkshire Hathaway also purchased $700 million of its own stock in the third quarter, an uptick from the $442 million it bought last quarter. The company purchased $1.7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter.\\nPreviously, the company did not allow stock buybacks. The board changed a rule last year to allow the company to begin purchasing back billions of dollars worth of stock, a practice that has been criticized by some analysts as inflating share prices.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)McDonald's Happy Meal might be for kids, but officially it's over the hill. \\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of the company's first Happy Meal, the kids meal that helped McDonald's achieve fast food supremacy. Today, roughly one in every four orders at McDonald's includes a Happy Meal, according to retail data tracker Sense360. \\nEach Happy Meal contains the option of a hamburger or chicken nuggets, a side like french fries and a drink. And a toy, some of which have become collector's items. \\nMcDonald's is celebrating this milestone by re-releasing some of its most popular toys over the past four decades, including Ty Beanie Babies' Patti the Platypus and the Tamagotchi. Between November 7 through 11, McDonald's (MCD) will sell a \"Surprise Happy Meal\" in 90 countries that will include the throwback toys.\\nIt's the latest quick-service restaurant to tap into nostalgia to excite customers. Since fast-food customers are not particularly loyal to any brand,  fast-food companies must resort to marketing tactics or wacky food creations to draw in customers.\\nHere's a brief history of the Happy Meal:\\n1979\\nThe Circus Wagon Happy Meal, as it was originally known, launched in the United States in June 1979. The meal included a hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and cookies. Some of the early Happy Meal toys included a McDoodler stencil, McWrist wallet and a spinning top. The box became instantly recognizable with the meal. \\n1982\\nAfter becoming a hit in the United States, McDonald's expanded the meal internationally. It debuted first in Latin America before hitting Australia and New Zealand. \\n1984\\nMcDonald's added McNuggets as a Happy Meal option. The addition inspired a line of Happy Meal toys modeled after the McNuggets.\\n1991\\nMcDonald's partnered with United Airlines (UAL) to offer Happy Meals on some of its flights. The deal ended in 2001.\\n1998\\nThe first-ever global Happy Meal debuted with Disney film \"Mulan.\" The meal had identical packaging and toys across 40 countries.\\n2012 - 2013\\nAs its customers shifted toward healthier eating habits, McDonald's began overhauling the Happy Meal. In 2012, McDonald's made the french fries portion smaller, and it added fruit as an option. In 2013, it added milk or juice as beverage choices.\\n2018\\nMcDonald's said it would provide cheeseburgers in Happy Meals only upon request. It removed artificial preservatives from some of its entrees and added bottled water as a drink option. The company said that 3.4 billion fruit, low-fat dairy and water items have been served in Happy Meals in the US since 2013.\\n2020\\nStarting next year, McDonald's will add a new reduced-sugar and low-fat chocolate milk option. It has 25% less sugar compared to the previous version.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)Toys \"R\" Us is returning to select malls in major metropolitan areas this holiday season with what it hopes is an innovative retail plan that could upend how stores sell toys.\\nIt comes two years after the company filed for bankruptcy and shuttered all its locations - seemingly for good - and just after toymaker Hasbro (HAS) reported disappointing third quarter sales heading into the industry's most crucial sales season. Hasbro's chief rival, Mattel (MAT), enjoyed a sales surge of 3% over the same period. Both toy companies' success was largely tied to Toys \"R\" Us prior to the retailer's financial demise and rebirth.\\nThe revamped Toys \"R\" Us will open two streamlined locations ahead of Black Friday in Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and The Galleria in Houston.\\n\"We know that customers love shopping as a means of entertainment. That's something built into the DNA of human beings,\" Richard Barry, president and CEO of Toys \"R\" Us parent company, Tru Kids, told CNN Business. \"We also know kids and families are looking for things to do on the weekends or when school's out. We know parents and families really value play and the value of toys overall. As we thought about the strategy, we wanted to put all those things together.\"\\nThese are not simply stores, according to the company. The store chain will partner with the retail service startup B8ta to create hands-on, engaging experiences for kids and their parents, who may have fond memories of Toys \"R\" Us from their own childhoods.\\nThe old Toys \"R\" Us stores were 40,000-square-foot behemoths with merchandise stacked on endless rows of metal shelves. The new stores are about 6,500 square feet, with interactive spaces where kids and parents can play with toys.\\nThe revalitized Toys \"R\" Us website also showcases fewer toys, but gives more details on them. Those looking to purchase items are redirected to Target's (TGT) website, which provides inventory and fulfillment services.\\nB8ta, which designs interactive stores displays where shoppers can try the latest products, will bring theaters, video games, and other engaging items to the new Toys \"R\" Us stores.\\n\"We've got a huge treehouse in the middle of the store that kids will be able to climb into, an event space for movies in the store. We'll have great brands in the store,\" Barry said.\\nJohn Goodman, CEO of Candytopia, helped implement this \"shop-o-tainment\" idea two years ago before partnering with Toys \"R\" Us earlier this year to launch \"Toys R Us Adventure,\" a touring indoor play space appearing in select malls across the country for a limited time. The ticketed attraction costs $20 for children ages 4-12 and $28 for adults. It features toy-themed play areas for small children who, the company hopes, will bug their parents to buy them merchandise associated with the fun zones they've just finished exploring. \\nThese pop-up playlands aren't permanent stores. After about six months they will set up shop somewhere else.\\nGoodman, who previously served as CEO of The Gap (GPS), Kmart, and Sears, used a similar blueprint to help Candytopia founder Jackie Sorkin turn her birthday party and event business into a multi-million dollar, confection-themed touring attraction celebrated by celebrity influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore.\\nToys \"R\" Adventure's first run in Chicago and Atlanta generated national headlines last week as families celebrated the return of the familiar retail brand.  Pictures and videos of smiling, laughing children walking through imitation snow caves and interacting with the Toys \"R\" Us mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, are circulating now on Instagram and Facebook.\\nThe Toys \"R\" Us Adventure in Atlanta's Lenox Marketplace shopping complex was nearly filled to capacity, Goodman said. \\n\"We feel like we're adding a service to the mall in terms of driving additional traffic, anything from 1,700 to 2,200 people every single day,\" Goodman told CNN Business. \"It's like the circus. The circus comes to town and the circus leaves. It may or may not be back in a couple of years. That's how our model is built.\"\\nThis idea isn't exactly new, but it is catching on elsewhere. The minds behind New Jersey's new American Dream mall, which opened on Friday, came up with a similar concept. The Rutherford, New Jersey shopping complex is less a place to buy consumer goods and more of an indoor theme park with cartoon-themed attractions in its Nickelodeon Universe. It also has an indoor ski slope, a water park, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink.\\nScott Webb, CEO of the digital consulting firm Avionos, says this may be the future of toy-related, brick-and-mortar retail shopping. Encouraging kids to play with toys that aren't tied to TV, movie, or video game characters is crucial for the industry, which has struggled in an era when children binge watching shows on streaming services often avoid commercials advertising toys that they won't see on their favorite shows.\\n\"Kids as much as anything are digital consumers now,\" Webb told CNN Business. \"The Hasbro numbers back this up. The segments of toys that have really thrived are those tied to some intellectual property, whether it's Fortnite or Marvel or Star Wars.\" \\nWebb said Toys \"R\" Us turning its company into a toy discovery brand as opposed to a retailer may be a good strategy. \"I think they absolutely have a lot of brand equity to carve out a new niche in that role,\" he continued. \"But I think it would be hard to predict them ever discovering the same dominance in retail.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Busines)America's top supermarkets are facing a new challenge: Grocery aisles in stores aren't suited to meet the growing demand for online orders.\\nSo Walmart, Albertsons, Stop &amp; Shop, Meijer, Hy-Vee and others are building automated mini-warehouses inside their stores and opening up \"dark stores\" — locations that look like supermarkets but are closed to customers — to make deliveries and prepare pickup orders.\\nAlthough only around 5% of US shoppers buy their groceries online today, analysts expect that number to rise in the coming years.\\nWalmart has trained more than 30,000 workers to fulfill customers' online grocery orders, but in some cases that has led to congested aisles with workers in its own stores during peak shopping times, such as weekends.\\nWalmart US chief Greg Foran earlier this year said an executive complained to him, \"'I hate shopping in the store on Sunday trying to get up and down the aisles.'\"\\nFor grocers that partner with third-party services, often \"there are as many people selecting for Instacart as there are customers,\" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail and grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.\\nGrocery store margins are tight. And workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is expensive for grocers. That's why grocers are looking to technology to reduce costs and keep aisles from jamming up.\\n'Micro-fulfillment centers' \\nAlbertsons and Stop &amp; Shop are testing automated \"micro-fulfillment centers\" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.\\nStop &amp; Shop, owned by Dutch parent Ahold Delhaize, is building a 12,000-square-foot fully automated fulfillment center in the backroom of a store in Windsor, Connecticut, for deliveries in the Hartford area. Stop &amp; Shop offers delivery through its online Peapod service.\\nMeijer announced this month that it will also begin testing micro-fulfillment with a logistics company to \"maximize space in our stores\" and expand online options, said Sid Handa, the company's director of strategic supply chain initiatives.\\nAnd in Salem, New Hampshire, Walmart is piloting a system with autonomous carts that gather customers' grocery orders and bring them to Walmart workers, who then prepare them for delivery or pickup.\\nSome analysts say these models are an advantage over large, centralized warehouses, which are often located further away from customers than stores. That's why micro-fulfillment centers can save grocers in delivery costs, according to experts.\\n\"Micro-fulfillment helps retailers solve the labor and last-mile costs conundrum,\" Christopher Mandeville, analyst at Jefferies, said in a research report earlier this month. \\nMandeville estimates that the cost of delivering groceries from central warehouses is usually around two times higher than using micro-fulfillment in stores. Jefferies cut Kroger's stock earlier this month in part because the company has invested in centralized facilities through a deal with Ocado, instead of micro-fulfillment.\\nGrocers are also moving the picking process out of stores entirely and testing so-called dark stores. Some dark stores have automation, while others are still manned by employees to do all of the picking of goods purchased online, said Mandeville.\\n\"Dark stores in grocery are an emerging trend,\" said Michael Demko, founder of grocery consulting firm Locai Solutions.\\nWalmart recently opened Walmart Pickup Point, a 40,000-square-foot prototype outside of Chicago at a former Dominick's grocery store. Customers drive up to the site to designated parking spots, and a Walmart worker loads up their trunk with their order. Walmart can also make deliveries from the location. \\nThe inside of the location looks like a Walmart with groceries and everyday items. Unlike a traditional Walmart supercenter, however, customers won't be able go inside.\\nStop &amp; Shop has an approximately 40,000-square-foot dark store in Whitman, Massachusetts, on the site of a former grocery store tailored to make deliveries.\\nAnd Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, is testing four dark stores. The inside looks similar to a store but without signs, according to a spokesperson for the company.\\nThe locations are designed to fill shoppers' online orders while allowing traditional stores to \"continue to serve the needs of those who enjoy the in-store experience,\" the Hy-Vee spokesperson said.\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of Stop &amp; Shop's 'dark store' in Massachusetts.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)The chilling story of Jayme Closs, the 13-year-old Wisconsin girl who was kidnapped after her parents were killed last year, was national news.\\nBut people might be less familiar with the story of Arianna Fitts, a 2-year-old who went missing in 2016 before her mother was found brutally murdered in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\nEach of these cases is compelling, but the two didn't receive the same amount of media attention. Some experts believe it's because Closs is white and Fitts is black.\\nIn fact, data shows that missing white children receive far more media coverage than missing black and brown children, despite higher rates of missing children among communities of color.\\nThe FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database lists 424,066 missing children under 18 in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. About 37 percent of those children are black, even though black children only make up about 14 percent of all children in the United States.\\nIt's harder to say how many Hispanic kids are missing. The FBI's report groups white and Hispanic children together. Based on other reports, about 20 percent of missing children are Hispanic or Latino, according to Robert Lowery, vice president of the missing child division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). But the real number, he said, is likely higher.\\n\"I think there's a false belief that white children make up the biggest number of missing children when in fact (proportionally) it's just the opposite,\" Lowery said, adding that the high number of black girls reported missing is particularly concerning.\\nHere are some reasons experts say we don't hear more about missing children of color:\\nTheir families are hesitant to call police\\nSome families are hesitant to contact law enforcement, even if they think their child is missing.\\n\"There's a sense of distrust between law enforcement and the minority community,\" said Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation.\\nThat distrust contributes to a \"silent code of 'no snitching,'\" Wilson said, adding that it is important for people who suspect a child is missing to speak up.\\n\"It could be your child, your mother, your father that's missing,\" she said. \"You would want someone to speak up to help find them.\"\\nOther families might not report that their child is missing because they fear it could have unintended, negative consequences. \\nFor example, Lowery suspects missing Latino children are underreported because some families with undocumented members might not contact police for fear of being deported. \\nThey don't get as much media coverage\\nNews media organizations have often been criticized for not giving missing black children the amount of attention they give missing white kids. \\nA 2010 study found that black children were significantly underrepresented in TV news. Even though about a third of all missing children in the FBI's database were black, they only made up about 20 percent of the missing children cases covered in the news. \\nA 2015 study was bleaker: though black children accounted for about 35% of missing children cases in the FBI's database, they amounted to only 7% of media references.\\nExperts say media coverage is vital to helping solve those cases.\\n\"It puts law enforcement on alert, and they add additional resources to the case,\" Wilson said. \"If no one knows about it, then no one's doing anything to find them or to help them get the assistance they need.\"\\nFamilies don't have the resources\\nFamilies don't always have the financial resources to respond appropriately when their child is missing. They might not be able to afford a private investigator or take off from work to help look for their child and follow up with law enforcement and the media. \\nAnd in some cases, they may not know what to do.\\nWilson said some people are under the misconception that they must wait 48 hours before filing a police report, when that waiting period varies by location. Places like Illinois or Washington, DC, don't have waiting periods to report a child missing.\\nKnowing the laws in your state helps. And when in doubt, contact law enforcement immediately. \\nThere are other resources that families can utilize as well.\\nThe Black and Missing Foundation helps families of color file police reports, create missing posters and spread the word about missing children.\\nFacebook groups offer an online community for parents to alert the public about their missing child and ask questions of others who have had similar experiences. \\nEliseo Montoya, who runs the Facebook group Runaway and Missing Children in California, said he keeps the page going because it allows families to feel like they're doing something even when it seems like authorities are giving up. \\n\"A page like mine is very important for people of color because nobody really embraces people of color,\" Montoya said.\\nSome get classified as runaways\\nWhen most people think of missing children, they think of young children abducted by strangers. But missing children can refer to kids who are abducted by relatives or children who leave home, either voluntarily or after being lured by someone else.\\nMany missing children of color are classified as runaways, Wilson said. And while running away from home isn't a problem unique to nonwhite children, they are particularly vulnerable. \\nA significant number of nonwhite children who go missing are either homeless or in foster care, said Wilson, and many are at risk for sex trafficking. Data shows black children are overrepresented in foster care and are at a much higher risk for homelessness. \\nLaw enforcement often classify children of color as runaways without having all the details, Wilson said. Because those kids are considered to have voluntarily left home, Amber alerts aren't sent out about them and they typically aren't covered in the news. \\nRunaway cases and abductions by family members don't get the same attention that abductions by non-family members or strangers do. But all these scenarios fall under the \"missing\" umbrella. A child is missing if they are under the age of 18 and their legal guardian doesn't know where they are.\\nThe NCMEC no longer distinguishes between runaways and abductions on their posters of missing children.\\n\"Frankly, we were dealing with a desensitized public and media when we did that,\" Lowery said. \"Now if you check our website, our children are just listed as missing child.\"\\nWilson stressed that runaway cases should be treated with the same urgency.\\n\"We have to be mindful,\" she said. \"What did they leave from, and what are they ultimately running to?\"\\nSometimes, children of color get classified as runaways when they are truly missing. Wilson said her organization has seen many such cases. \\n\"We tell parents all the time, you know your child better than anyone else, their behavior, their characteristics,\" she said. \"If you believe your child did not run away, you just have to stand firm with law enforcement and let them know that this is uncharacteristic of your child.\" \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)C-H-A-O-S.\\nThat's been the watchword of Donald Trump's presidency -- a roiling, sprawling circus of content and controversy that never slows down and never rests. Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?\\nThe answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\\nConsider what we've seen just since Friday:\\n1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card\\n2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\\n3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \\n4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\\n5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\\n6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \\n7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails\\nAnd in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\\nThe rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.\\nAt one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\\nAnd the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\\nFrom a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \\nBut by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\\nEven for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.\\nNow consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\\nThe real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)A senior adviser to Vice President Mike Pence is likely to comply with a request to testify on Thursday in front of the committees leading the impeachment inquiry, multiple sources say.\\nJennifer Williams would be the first person on Pence's national security team to appear and has knowledge of how much the vice president knew about the efforts by President Donald Trump and those around him to push Ukraine to launch investigations into Joe Biden and his son, as well as 2016 election interference, according to a source familiar with her thinking. \\nWilliams, along with other senior administration and national security officials, was listening to the phone call on July 25 in which Trump asked for a \"favor\" of his newly-elected Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, a White House source says. Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\\nWilliams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\\nPence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\\nLawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.\\nOver a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\\nSince then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\\nThe three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nCurrent and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\\nThe official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces. Until Williams joined Pence's staff, she was a spokesperson for several years at the US embassy in London, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also held posts at the embassies in Beirut, Lebanon and Kingston, Jamaica.\\n\"Jen is the type of person who I know to be dedicated to the institution above anything else,\" said Brett Bruen, the former Director of Global Engagement at the White House under President Barack Obama.\\nShe comes from the cadre of diplomats \"who are not going to be easily intimidated or hold back information,\" Bruen added. \"She is someone who is pretty tough and has had tough assignments that have steeled her to the kind of pressure and the intimidation tactics that have been used against others.\"\\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more precisely reflect Williams' role.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)It used to be said that \"all politics is local.\" That's not really the case anymore. \\nVoters may be casting ballots for politicians to state government, but their feelings about President Donald Trump will be paramount. That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \\nKentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \\nYet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \\nIf Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \\nThe same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \\nThe polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \\nYou can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \\nHood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \\nAfter the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \\nIf there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \\nThose slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \\nWere Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\\nI would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \\nStill, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)The outcome of races in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia on Tuesday could shed light on how the country is leaning in the middle of an impeachment inquiry and as it heads into a presidential election year. \\nAs the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump deepens in Washington, voters will head to the polls a year after Democrats took the US House, testing the political landscape. \\nVoters will decide the next governors of Kentucky and Mississippi, two solidly red states that voted for Trump in 2016. The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. \\nAll eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates.\\nHere's a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: \\nKentucky governor \\nRepublican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state's attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   \\nTrump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor's office in the state. \\nTrump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin's victory came within 10 points of his opponent.\\nMedicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.\\nIn 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\\nBeshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \\nPolls close at 6 p.m. local time. \\nMississippi governor\\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  \\nTrump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \\nCook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\\nHood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \\nThere is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nVice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. \\nVirginia legislature \\nRepublicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\\nDemocrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\\nDemocrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.\\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.\\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)There are plenty of people arguing that President Donald Trump is breaking the law by encouraging news organizations to out the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine triggered the impeachment investigation.\\nHere's the problem with that view: The President is the law when it comes to protecting national security whistleblowers. And now it's the President who is leading the attack. \\n\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \\nHe's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\\nBut the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \\nThere are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\\nWhen that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\\nKohn added: \"If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\\nAnd Trump has made clear where he stands. \\nHe wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\\n\"It's a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\\nBut certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\\nThe whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\\nHarassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\\n\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\\nDevine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\\nHe ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\\nBut that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\\nAnd then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\\nBut no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \\n\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\\nToobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\\n\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\\nBut that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\\nUltimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)News footage from an October 20, 2018, midterm election rally in Nevada shows indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas standing behind President Donald Trump.\\nParnas and his business partner and fellow Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, are alleged by prosecutors to have illegally funded donations from foreign nations to Republican political campaigns in attempts to buy influence. They are also alleged to have aided Giuliani, the President's personal attorney, in efforts to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe video of the rally is the latest example of how the pair who had little record of donations to candidates before 2018, wielded their proximity to Giuliani and used political donations to gain access to the president and political campaigns. Photos and videos throughout 2018 and 2019 show the pair traveling with the former New York City mayor throughout the world and to political events across the country.\\nThe footage was found by CNN's KFile during a review of the travel and political activity of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman.\\nParnas and Fruman were arrested in October attempting to leave the country. They were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week to the charges. Parnas and Fruman were ordered to house confinement and subject to GPS monitoring after they each secured a $1 million bond. \\nIn the videos, Parnas sits in the area directly behind Trump before and during the rally.  Parnas, who at times is wearing a blue hat and glasses, can be seen apparently taking a video of the President on his cellphone as he walks up the stairs to the stage.\\nAt another point, Parnas leaves the area behind the podium to be along the path of the Trump's exit at the bottom of the stage. He waves to the president as he leaves, and the president waves back in the direction of Parnas and the crowd.\\nIt is unclear how Parnas, who is not a Nevada native, got into the prized seating area directly behind the President. A photo from Parnas' Instagram featured in a video by the Wall Street Journal shows he appeared to have a VIP badge for the event.\\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman since their indictment.\\n\"I don't know those gentlemen,\" the President said earlier this month. \"Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here.\"\\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump added. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do but I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy, I just don't know.\"\\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman returned a request for comment. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. A lawyer for Fruman did not return a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. \\nRally mentioned in indictments\\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York described the October 2018 rally in the 21-page indictment of Parnas, Fruman and their associates David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were both indicted on a conspiracy charge. Correia and Kukushkin have also pleaded not guilty.\\nThe prosecutors wrote that \"on or about October 20, 2018,\" Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for \"Candidate-1\" in Nevada and took photos with \"Candidate-2.\" The trio then sent the photographs to \"Foreign National-1,\" whose identity has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe candidates were later identified as Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wesley Duncan. Trump appeared at the rally to campaign for Laxalt. A photo from Parnas' now-private Instagram, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal, shows him and Fruman posing for a photograph with Laxalt previously during a September 2018 fundraiser. A spokesperson for Laxalt told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he \"doesn't know the man.\"\\nOne of several midterm events attended by Parnas and Fruman  \\nThe Trump rally in Nevada was one of many events attended by Fruman and Parnas in the final weeks heading up the November 2018 midterm elections.\\nIn photos posted on Twitter, Parnas and Fruman can be seen accompanying Giuliani to events in Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Indiana and again in Nevada.\\nA November 3, 2018, tweet of a several photos from Michigan Senate candidate John James shows James sitting at a table with Giuliani and Parnas. In another photo, James can be seen speaking while Fruman sits in the first row of seats and Parnas stand with Giuliani off to the side. \\nPictures tweeted that same day from Giuliani and congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian show Giuliani with Parnas and Fruman while campaigning in Nevada. A video from that morning also shows Fruman and Parnas with Giuliani as he campaigns in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun.\\nAnother campaign event for then-Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on November 4, 2018, shows Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman among attendees according to photos shared from DeSantis's Twitter account.\\nParnas was also seen with Giuliani at campaign events for New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Eddie Edwards. Photos posted on Twitter show Edwards and Giuliani addressing supporters at several campaign events on November 5, 2018 -- the day before the midterm election -- with Parnas standing near Giuliani.\\n</td>\n",

Elizabeth Warren has the support of 22%, with a tight cluster of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (19%), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and Former Vice President Joe Biden (17%) all within striking distance of Warren.\\nThe results in the early voting state do not bode well for Biden and are similar to a September CNN/Des Moines Regiser/Mediacom poll in which Warren challenged Biden's dominance in the race. \\nThis also marks a jump for Buttigieg, who previously lagged behind the three longstanding frontrunners and clocked in at 9% in CNN's poll in Iowa last month.\\nBehind them, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar lands at 4%, and California Sen. Kamala Harris and businessman Andrew Yang at 3% each in Friday's poll. The poll is Klobuchar's second poll that meets the standard to qualify for the December Democratic presidential debate, which requires 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC's criteria or 6% in two early state polls between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12.\\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Tom Steyer all garnered 2% of support.\\nTwo-thirds of likely caucusgoers in the poll said they could still change their minds about whom to support.\\nThe Times/Siena survey was conducted from Oct. 25-30, questioned 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's campaign says House Democrats' vote to formally launch an impeachment inquiry has only emboldened the President's supporters and bolstered their campaign contributions. \\n\"Nancy Pelosi's impeachment resolution day turned into a MASSIVE fundraising day for ??@realDonaldTrump?,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Friday morning. \\nAccording to Parscale, the campaign raised $3 million online in one day, totaling $19 million in funds raised over the course of the month. \\nThe $3 million addition came the same day the House passed the resolution, which the campaign called a \"sham.\" \\n\"Today's vote merely proves that the entire impeachment process was a sham from the beginning and Nancy Pelosi can't legitimize it after the fact,\" Parscale said in a statement following the resolution vote. \"Voters will punish Democrats who support this farce and President Trump will be easily re-elected.\"\\nTrump's one-day haul highlights his campaign's heavy use of digital advertising to reach potential supporters and donors -- a year ahead of the 2020 election.\\nThe campaign's heaviest spending isn't in swing states, such as Michigan or Pennsylvania, but in donor-rich parts of the country, such as Texas and California, according to a CNN tally of Facebook advertising data compiled by the Democratic-leaning firm Bully Pulpit Interactive.\\nThe Lone Star State received the biggest share of Facebook spending by the Trump campaign and its affiliated Trump Make America Great Again Committee since late March of this year -- nearly 9% of its total spending on the platform, the data show.\\nThe fundraising bump also came during the final days of the month, a period when nearly all active political campaigns rally supporters to ramp up contributions ahead of the close of the monthly report to the Federal Election Commission. The campaign push, in the final week of this month, included offers to triple and even quintuple all donations.  \\nThe Trump campaign has been positioning itself this fall to be ready to capitalize on Trump's perceived accomplishments and political battles. \\nDuring the final game of the World Series earlier this week, the campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy, airing a video nationally which checked off the President's accomplishments and went after his Washington rivals. It focuses on Trump's efforts to combat ISIS and boost the economy, and it also highlights his battles with Democrats and the Russia investigation.\\nOn Friday, a day after the House vote, Facebook ads from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee asked supporters to \"add your name\" to the people willing to \"Stand with President Trump\" in the face of the impeachment inquiry.\\nSupporters then are encouraged to leave their names, email addresses, ZIP codes and mobile numbers.\\nIn a recent conference call with reporters, a Trump official called the reelection effort a \"digital first campaign\" that can swiftly seize on fast-moving news, such as developments in the impeachment inquiry, to target voters and test and tweak advertising messages on digital platforms.\\n\"They are running a highly sophisticated operation,\" Reid Vineis, vice president for digital at Republican ad-buying firm Majority Strategies, said of the Trump operation. \"The Trump campaign has been essentially building a database for the 2020 general election.\"\\nOf particular value: The campaign's collection of mobile phone numbers.\\n\"Politics is much more effective at a one-to-one level,\" Vineis said. \"Text messages are read almost 100% of the time. The Trump campaign's accumulation of all this text-messaging data gives them a direct line to voters.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hong Kong (CNN Business)A growing number of smaller companies are adopting a four-day workweek. Now the results of a recent trial at Microsoft (MSFT) suggest it could work even for the biggest businesses.\\nThe company introduced a program this summer in Japan called the \"Work Life Choice Challenge,\" which shut down its offices every Friday in August and gave all employees an extra day off each week.\\nThe results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year, the company said in a statement last week. \\nIn addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails. \\nThey suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft's, of course).\\nThe effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft's 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company. \\nBy shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity. \\nThe initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — culture of overwork. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: karoshi means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.\\nThe issue attracted international attention in 2015, when an employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu committed suicide on Christmas Day. Tokyo officials later said that the staffer had worked excessive amounts of overtime.\\nTwo years later, a reporter at a Japanese broadcaster died after working punishing long hours. Her employer said she had clocked in 159 hours of overtime the month before her death.\\nThat has led businesses to start searching for solutions. Some companies have begun offering employees more flexibility, and the government has launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday,\" which encourages workers to leave early every last Friday of the month.\\nMicrosoft, for its part, says it will conduct another experiment in Japan later this year. It plans to ask employees to come up with new measures to improve work-life balance and efficiency, and will also ask other companies to join the initiative.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)Starbucks aims to get bigger by going smaller, with a new store format that's a fraction the size of its normal cafe. \\nThe coffee chain is opening \"Starbucks Pick-Up,\" a first-of-its-kind location in the United States that encourages orders from its app. The store, located near New York City's Penn Station, opens Tuesday. Plans for the store were announced in September.\\nThe new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company's vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want \"convenience, comfort and connection\" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. \\nYoung said the store is meant to be \"predictable and effortless\" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. \\nThe store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe's 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. \\nThe design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.\\nCustomers aren't required to order from Starbucks' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. \\nThe digitally focused store is part of the company's goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. \\nStarbucks Pick-Up will help the company \"test and learn\" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.\\nThe new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That's a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. \\nStarbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It's similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. \\nCEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' earnings call this week that it's \"seeing encouraging early results\" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China's largest cities. \\nBoth Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company's portfolio of stores that are \"tuned to different needs at different times,\" Young said. \\nOn the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world's largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November. The four-story Chicago location is 43,000 square feet and is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location on the city's Magnificent Mile.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)I had a pair of new $249 AirPods Pro for less than 12 minutes when one tumbled out of my ear and landed an inch from the edge of a train platform. \\n\"I really thought you were going to go after it if it fell,\" the stranger next to me scoffed.\\nThe high-end earbuds are a lot of things: an audiophile's dream, a fashion statement, Snoopy's face in headphone form. But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple's starting model, you'll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple's original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product. \\nIn a sense, this is Apple (AAPL) doing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones. \\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes, mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple's rivals. It's a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it's become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple's product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\\n Apple hasn't shared how many AirPods it's sold, but the company's wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it's hard not to believe it. \\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned, with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it's tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it's like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ. \\nFor those moments when you don't want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people's voices without sacrificing what you're listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual's ear canal's shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud. \\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it's still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem. \\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car. \\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I'd argue he's right. AirPod loyalists are fanatical about the earbuds, and the love for them is about to get even deeper. \\nBuzz around the new Pro version will undoubtedly convince other Apple users to make a purchase, too. They'll also soon know the pain and anguish of (almost) losing a fallen earpiece.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)On Monday night at a campaign rally in Kentucky, home state Sen. Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \\nHere's what Paul said:\\n\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'\"\\nPaul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information &amp; dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\\nWhile that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\\nWhat Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\\nThat's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\\nHere's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\\nThe task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\\nTo date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\\nFixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\\nBut thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\\nWhat Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\\nIt's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\\nTo which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)All eyes are on Kentucky Tuesday, as Gov. Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\\nI asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\nCillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\\nBailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\\nBevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\\nGoforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.\\nAttorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\\nCillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\\nBailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\\nBut there are some clear differences between the two. \\nThe President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\\nBevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\\nCillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\\nBailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\\nAndy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\\nHe also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\\nCillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\\nBailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\\nBailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\\nThe President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\\nTrump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)Faced with a slew of national polls that show roughly half the country supports not only his impeachment but also his removal from office, President Donald Trump did what he always does: Just say stuff.\\n\"Well, you're reading the wrong polls. You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You're read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\\nThat response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\\nA bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\\nOn Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \\n\"If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!\".\\nAnd then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \\n\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\\nPresumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\\nWhich is fine! And smart!\\n(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\\nBut if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \\nThink of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\\nThat's not to say Trump's \"real\" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.\\nAnd honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\\nWhy haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\\nNo matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\\n</td>\n",

Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.\\nBut the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.\\nCastro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)The Justice Department said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are \"legally invalid\" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.\\nThe guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.\\nImpeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.\\nIn the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\\nThe five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.\\nOLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\\nThe administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\\nThe memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\\n</td>\n",

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\nSeveral other Republicans have called for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator's insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\\nDuring the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\nThe anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\\nOn Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \\nZaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.\\nIn September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.\\nTwo sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\\n'Deeply troubling and disappointing' \\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.\\n\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,\" King said. \\n\"It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \\nLater on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\\nRaskin argued that the \"attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic\" that is a \"distraction from the merits of the case.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)While senators await the House of Representatives to move into the public phase of their impeachment inquiry, aides and members are beginning to prepare for a likely Senate trial.\\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are cautious: there are no articles of impeachment and the House hasn't voted to impeach the President. But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \\nTalks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. \\nThat room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\\nAnd, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\\n\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\\nSenate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.\\nSchumer's office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House's impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.\\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\\nSchumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\\nA key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\\nThere is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections. Both were in the Senate for Clinton's trial in January and February of 1999. Frequent Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a congressman from South Carolina, was also one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's defenses of his actions often change over time. They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. \\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" He claimed that the \"many people\" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.\\nThen he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\\nBreaking down Trump's comments\\nHere is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \\n\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\\nGot that?\\nLet's break it down claim by claim.\\n1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.\\n2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\\n3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\\n4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\\nIn summary: Trump went from\\nA) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to\\nB) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\\nC) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \\nD) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\\nHe can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:\\nA fact check\\nAs Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" \\nThe Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call's aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\\nThe whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \\nThe White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \\nTrump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\\nIt was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\\n</td>\n",

Under the sentence, Olsen is prohibited from working in law enforcement, possessing firearms or profiting from the case. \\nDear Jackson praised what she said was the strength, fortitude and compassion of the family of the victim, 26-year-old Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. She said she had also watched the defendant closely during the trial. \\n\"Many might have thought you were stoic and void of emotion,\" the judge told Olsen. \"From the time opening statements started, I saw the tears that you've had. I saw how you replayed March 9, 2015, in your head.\" \\nProsecutors had asked the court for a 25-year sentence with five years probation. \\nA jury last month acquitted Olsen of murder in the March 2015 death of Hill but found him guilty of aggravated assault, making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath.\\nJurors deliberated for more than a week. Olsen had faced up to 35 years in prison.\\nBefore sentencing, the court heard from Hill's mother, father and sister.\\n\"The decision Robert Olsen made that day changed my life forever,\" said his mother, Carolyn Baylor Giummo. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\\nShe remembered her son as a compassionate child, a talented choir singer and student-athlete whose life seemed to change after his deployment to Afghanistan.   \\n\"He didn't come back unscathed,\" she said. At the time of the shooting, Hill had had stopped taking his medications because of side effects and suffered a breakdown, she said. \\nGiummo recalled her father always telling her and his grandchildren that \"if you're ever in trouble, run to the police.\"\\n\"The jury may have found Mr. Robert Olsen not guilty of murder but he still killed my son,\" she told the court. \"He has never taken responsibility for taking my son's life. He's never just said, 'I'm sorry for killing Tony.'\"\\n Anthony Hill, Sr., said he felt as if he had failed as a father for not protecting his son. He lamented that the defendant never once looked him in the eye with an expression of remorse. \\n\"I stood out in that passageway many a day just hoping to make a little bit of eye contact,\" he said. \"Not one time would he look my way.\"\\nOlsen's wife, Catherine, read a statement in court. She said one of the few times she saw her husband break down emotionally was after he killed Hill. \\n\"He was mourning for the individual whose life he had taken,\" she said, adding that she and Olsen recognize the pain of Hill's family. \\n\"I cannot imagine how hard this had been for his parents and family,\" she said.  \\nCatherine Olsen was overcome by emotion as her husband was taken away by officers after the sentencing.\\nOlsen did not address the court.\\nBefore the shooting, someone in Hill's neighborhood called police to report a man was \"acting deranged, knocking on doors, and crawling around on the ground naked,\" then-DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said then.\\nOlsen was dispatched, and \"when (Hill) saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer. The officer called him to stop while stepping backwards, drew his weapon and fired two shots,\" Alexander said.\\nDefense attorney Amanda Clark Palmer said Olsen, who worked for the DeKalb County police, was \"a good cop who had to make a tough decision.\"\\nHill's girlfriend previously said he had a history of mental illness and struggled to get the support he needed from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had stopped taking his medication shortly before his death, she said. \\nDuring closing arguments, the prosecution claimed Olsen did not follow protocol for using force. Assistant District Attorney Lance Cross said Olsen could have used a baton on Hill.\\n   \n",

hundreds of thousands of people remain without power after storms swept through much of the eastern US on Halloween. \\nRetired priest John Thomas Connery, 82, was on his way to a church in Newport, New York, on Thursday night, when he was swept away by floodwater, according to a deacon who worked with Connery at various churches in the area.\\nConnery disobeyed a traffic control signal and drove into a flooded area in Norway, New York, said Michael Kopy, the state's director of emergency management. Connery got out of his car after it got stuck when the shoulder of the road collapsed, Kopy said. He lost his footing and was swept away, New York State Police said in a release.\\nConnery, who had served for 56 years and lived about 60 miles away in Glenville, planned to spend the night in the rectory and lead the All Saints Day mass in Newport on Friday morning, Deacon Jim Bower of the Holy Family Parish in Hicksville, told CNN. \\n\"It's always a tragedy when anyone passes away and I think we always take it harder when its someone that we know and have a great deal of respect and love for,\" Bower said.\\nBishop Edward B. Scharfenberger of the Diocese of Albany said Father Connery \"died as he lived -- serving the people of God without fear or concern for himself.\"\\nGeorge Walker, 79, died after high winds caused a tree to fall on his car Thursday in Knoxville, Tennessee, said Knoxville Police communications manager Scott Erland.\\n Walker was taken to a local medical center and later died of his injuries, police said.\\n\"It was a horrible situation,\" Erland said.\\nNearly 600,000 customers remained without power Friday from Virginia to Maine after storms swept through Thursday evening. Most of the outages were reported in New York and Maine.\\nCon Edison workers were working to restore service in Queens, New York, near John F. Kennedy International Airport, CNN affiliate WABC reported.\\nWinds blew trees down, and roofing materials and debris were stuck in power lines, the station reported.\\nTens of thousands of customers were also without power in Pennsylvania, Vermont, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\\nMore than 20 low-temperature records were set Thursday from the Midwest to the East Coast, CNN meteorologists said.\\n   \n",

                                            Washington (CNN)The winner of Mississippi's gubernatorial election Tuesday will not only have to capture the state's popular vote, but will also have to prevail in the state's unique election process for electing a governor and other statewide officials that was established during the Jim Crow era. \\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state's popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as \"leans Republican\" -- the state's unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. \\nA candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nThe election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. \\nCritics of the system have said it \"dilutes\" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. \\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\"Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,\" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.\\nThe provision increases white control because \"the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,\" the complaint said.\\nWhile Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.\\n   \n",
       "4    (CNN)Mary Kerrie Davis had smoked cigarettes for most of her adult life, when she embraced vaping as a way to quit.\\nFor several years, the 52-year-old mother from Georgia vaped only nicotine. But after trying THC cartridges, she began to experience health problems. On September 6, she died.\\nMary Kerrie's case sounds like the nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related injury confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of this week, the outbreak has led to 37 vaping-related deaths in 24 states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands.\\nMany of those cases and deaths were among people who vaped THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.\\n\"The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters in October. \"But I'd like to stress that we don't know what the risky material or substance is. THC may be a marker for a way that cartridges were prepared or way that the devices are producing harm.\"\\nMary Kerrie's death hasn't yet been counted in the CDC's total. Her grieving family has many questions still without answers. But they believe that vaping THC is what ultimately led to her death.\\nFrom smoking to vaping\\nWhen Mary Kerrie transitioned to vaping nicotine a few years ago, she stopped smoking cigarettes completely, her daughter, Maggie Davis, said. Mary Kerrie was adamant with family and friends that vaping was healthier than smoking.\\n\"She thought it was safer,\" her husband, Kevin Davis, said. \"I certainly liked the fact that there wasn't the cigarette smell and her breath didn't smell like cigarettes. I kind of thought it was better, too.\"\\nMaggie remembers that her mom came to California this summer to help her move into her dorm for her senior year of college. While there, Mary Kerrie went to a vape shop and purchased THC cartridges for the first time.\\nImmediately upon returning home, she developed a nagging cough. Kevin didn't know Mary Kerrie had been vaping THC cartridges. Only after her death did the Davis family learn that Mary Kerrie had continued buying and using THC cartridges in Georgia. Unlike in California, THC is illegal in the Davis' home state.\\n'I hope you don't have that vaping disease'\\nMary Kerrie experienced a steady decline in health between the time she started vaping THC cartridges and her death. The initial health effects she had experienced from vaping to quit smoking transitioned into frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a terrible cough. They're all among the reported symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\nMary Kerrie went to the hospital for assessment on September 4. A flu swab tested negative. She texted her daughter that she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nMaggie had just begun hearing reports of a national outbreak of a mystery illness related to vaping. She texted her mom, \"I hope you don't have that vaping disease.\"\\nOn the way home from the hospital, groaning between coughs, Mary Kerrie said, \"I'm never smoking again. I'm throwing out all of my e-cigarettes and weed pens,\" Maggie wrote in a personal essay for her college newspaper.\\nKevin, an OB/GYN, encouraged Mary Kerrie when she declared she was quitting it all.\\nStill, Mary Kerrie's symptoms became worse over the next two days. She stayed home from social gatherings, telling her husband that she just needed rest.\\nHe felt she should be seen again by a doctor.\\nDays later, on September 6, Mary Kerrie was still sick. It was Kevin who found her, lips blue and gasping for breath, whispering, \"help.\"\\nOn the way to the hospital again, Mary Kerrie's pulse was barely detectable. She'd become unresponsive.\\nAt the hospital, doctors performed CPR unsuccessfully.\\nMoments later, Mary Kerrie -- an outgoing 52-year-old who loved rollerskating and mountain biking, a mother and wife who was known for being vivacious and happy -- was gone.\\n\"She will never see her youngest daughter graduate high school, nor her oldest graduate college,\" Maggie wrote after her death. \"She will never see her daughters married or meet her grandchildren. Her absence, a sudden and jarring hole in my family, will be felt for decades to come.\"\\nIn X-rays on the day Mary Kerrie presented at the hospital, her lungs had looked clear. Two days later, they revealed a white substance resembling clouds infiltrating Mary Kerrie's lungs.\\n'From healthy to drowning in your own lungs'\\nTo the Davis family, the X-rays seemed to confirm what they had heard in the news: Mary Kerrie's illness wasn't simply a case of pneumonia. In addition to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, shortness of breath and chest pain, the whiteout in her lungs was one of the symptoms of vaping-related lung disease.\\n\"This wasn't a nursing home patient. This wasn't somebody with a chronic illness,\" Kevin said. \"You don't just go from healthy to drowning in your own lungs and a flatline EKG from things in your daily life.\"\\nNearly two months after Mary Kerrie's death, her case is still not part of the official CDC count of vaping-related lung injury deaths.\\nIn part, it speaks to just how new of a phenomenon this is. The ongoing investigation \"may take a few months\" and could yield \"multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,\" CDC's Schuchat told reporters early in October.\\nFor the Davis family, the wait has been frustrating. To them, it seems obvious that Mary Kerrie's death is related to vaping.\\nKevin said he recently spoke with a CDC official who said that his wife's case met the agency's definition of a vaping-related illness, but the agency is waiting for the county medical examiner's decision before making an announcement.\\nThere have already been three confirmed vaping-related deaths in Georgia. If and when it is announced, Mary Kerrie's death could be the fourth, potentially making Georgia's death count the highest in the United States.\\nMary Kerrie's legacy\\nThe Davis family and Mary Kerrie's friends want her to be remembered for the good she brought into their lives.\\n\"She was all in on me and all in on our daughters, all in on her family. Anything that she wanted to be a part of, it was everything for her,\" Kevin said of their 24-year marriage. \"Her energy is beautiful, and I sure miss her.\"\\nThe Davis family attributes part of the blame for Mary Kerrie's death to a lack of regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration.\\n\"Marijuana pens also boast exponentially higher numbers of THC, and yet we still do not know how this historically disproportionate consumption of marijuana affects the human body, particularly when consumed as an oil,\" Maggie wrote.\\nEarlier this month, the FDA warned consumers to stop using THC vaping products as investigations into vaping-related lung injuries and deaths continue. Last week, the CDC made a similar warning, saying \"CDC recommends that you should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC.\"\\n\"Mary Kerrie vaped [nicotine] products for several years I would say, successfully, and did quit smoking,\" Kevin said. \"I think when she was exposed to legal THC in California and then got illicit THC in Georgia ... I think that's what killed her.\"\\n\"Other people, if they're being exposed to something that can kill them, I hope they stop,\" Kevin said. \"I hope her passing helps somebody else.\"\\n   \n",

fundraising figure that he said was necessary in order to continue his campaign.\\nThe Castro campaign received more than $1 million in October from \"nearly 50,000 donors,\" according to a campaign statement, and on Thursday the campaign enjoyed its best fundraising day since August.\\nCastro had previously said that if he did not reach the $800,000 figure before the end of the month, he would have to end his 2020 bid. Fundraising has been a struggle for Castro, with the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor entering the fourth quarter of 2019 with less than $700,000 in the bank.\\n\"Time and time again this campaign has defied expectations with the support of an army of dedicated, grassroots supporters,\" Castro campaign manager Maya Rupert said in a statement Friday. \"We set an extremely ambitious goal to keep Secretary Castro's voice in this race, and our supporters met the challenge and delivered one of the best months of the campaign to date.\"\\nThe announcement of Castro's fundraising comes as the candidate heads to Iowa, a key early voting state, for the weekend to discuss affordable housing, according to the statement.\\nCastro has not yet qualified for the November debate, having failed to reach the 3% polling threshold despite meeting the donor requirement.\\n   \n",

              New York  (CNN Business)Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash pile keeps expanding, but Warren Buffett's industrial and insurance conglomerate has yet to make a major acquisition to ramp up growth.\\nBerkshire on Saturday reported it has $128 billion in cash, up from $122 billion in the second quarter.  \\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has lagged the market this year, and Buffett has said that he wants to make an \"elephant\" sized acquisition with the company's mountain of cash. The problem is that the market rally has made any potential targets much more expensive, and Buffett has said he doesn't want to overspend on deals.\\nBerkshire's operating profit rose to $7.9 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year earlier, boosted by gains across its holdings. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's performance is tied to its many subsidiaries -- which include GEICO, railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe and consumer brands like Duracell, Dairy Queen and paint maker Benjamin Moore -- as well as a massive investment portfolio.\\nBerkshire also said tariffs from the US-China trade war weighed on its consumer and industrial businesses. The tariffs cut into sales of Precision Castparts, it gas turbine and pipe products unit, the filings said. BNSF railroad saw a 5% profit gain due to cost-cutting measures to offset a drag from trade tensions.\\nWhile Berkshire has yet to make a major acquisition, the company has been taking steps to embrace more reasonably valued tech stocks in recent years. Berkshire Hathaway still owns large stakes in value stalwarts like Coke, (KO) Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (CBEAX) and Kraft Heinz, (KHC) which has taken billions of dollars in writedowns this year on some of its top brands.\\nBut the company's biggest holding now is Apple (AAPL), and Berkshire even has a small stake in Amazon (AMZN).\\nBerkshire Hathaway also purchased $700 million of its own stock in the third quarter, an uptick from the $442 million it bought last quarter. The company purchased $1.7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter.\\nPreviously, the company did not allow stock buybacks. The board changed a rule last year to allow the company to begin purchasing back billions of dollars worth of stock, a practice that has been criticized by some analysts as inflating share prices.\\n   \n",

Today, roughly one in every four orders at McDonald's includes a Happy Meal, according to retail data tracker Sense360. \\nEach Happy Meal contains the option of a hamburger or chicken nuggets, a side like french fries and a drink. And a toy, some of which have become collector's items. \\nMcDonald's is celebrating this milestone by re-releasing some of its most popular toys over the past four decades, including Ty Beanie Babies' Patti the Platypus and the Tamagotchi. Between November 7 through 11, McDonald's (MCD) will sell a \"Surprise Happy Meal\" in 90 countries that will include the throwback toys.\\nIt's the latest quick-service restaurant to tap into nostalgia to excite customers. Since fast-food customers are not particularly loyal to any brand,  fast-food companies must resort to marketing tactics or wacky food creations to draw in customers.\\nHere's a brief history of the Happy Meal:\\n1979\\nThe Circus Wagon Happy Meal, as it was originally known, launched in the United States in June 1979. The meal included a hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and cookies. Some of the early Happy Meal toys included a McDoodler stencil, McWrist wallet and a spinning top. The box became instantly recognizable with the meal. \\n1982\\nAfter becoming a hit in the United States, McDonald's expanded the meal internationally. It debuted first in Latin America before hitting Australia and New Zealand. \\n1984\\nMcDonald's added McNuggets as a Happy Meal option. The addition inspired a line of Happy Meal toys modeled after the McNuggets.\\n1991\\nMcDonald's partnered with United Airlines (UAL) to offer Happy Meals on some of its flights. The deal ended in 2001.\\n1998\\nThe first-ever global Happy Meal debuted with Disney film \"Mulan.\" The meal had identical packaging and toys across 40 countries.\\n2012 - 2013\\nAs its customers shifted toward healthier eating habits, McDonald's began overhauling the Happy Meal. In 2012, McDonald's made the french fries portion smaller, and it added fruit as an option. In 2013, it added milk or juice as beverage choices.\\n2018\\nMcDonald's said it would provide cheeseburgers in Happy Meals only upon request. It removed artificial preservatives from some of its entrees and added bottled water as a drink option. The company said that 3.4 billion fruit, low-fat dairy and water items have been served in Happy Meals in the US since 2013.\\n2020\\nStarting next year, McDonald's will add a new reduced-sugar and low-fat chocolate milk option. It has 25% less sugar compared to the previous version.\\n   \n",

Hasbro's chief rival, Mattel (MAT), enjoyed a sales surge of 3% over the same period. Both toy companies' success was largely tied to Toys \"R\" Us prior to the retailer's financial demise and rebirth.\\nThe revamped Toys \"R\" Us will open two streamlined locations ahead of Black Friday in Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, and The Galleria in Houston.\\n\"We know that customers love shopping as a means of entertainment. That's something built into the DNA of human beings,\" Richard Barry, president and CEO of Toys \"R\" Us parent company, Tru Kids, told CNN Business. \"We also know kids and families are looking for things to do on the weekends or when school's out. We know parents and families really value play and the value of toys overall. As we thought about the strategy, we wanted to put all those things together.\"\\nThese are not simply stores, according to the company. The store chain will partner with the retail service startup B8ta to create hands-on, engaging experiences for kids and their parents, who may have fond memories of Toys \"R\" Us from their own childhoods.\\nThe old Toys \"R\" Us stores were 40,000-square-foot behemoths with merchandise stacked on endless rows of metal shelves. The new stores are about 6,500 square feet, with interactive spaces where kids and parents can play with toys.\\nThe revalitized Toys \"R\" Us website also showcases fewer toys, but gives more details on them. Those looking to purchase items are redirected to Target's (TGT) website, which provides inventory and fulfillment services.\\nB8ta, which designs interactive stores displays where shoppers can try the latest products, will bring theaters, video games, and other engaging items to the new Toys \"R\" Us stores.\\n\"We've got a huge treehouse in the middle of the store that kids will be able to climb into, an event space for movies in the store. We'll have great brands in the store,\" Barry said.\\nJohn Goodman, CEO of Candytopia, helped implement this \"shop-o-tainment\" idea two years ago before partnering with Toys \"R\" Us earlier this year to launch \"Toys R Us Adventure,\" a touring indoor play space appearing in select malls across the country for a limited time. The ticketed attraction costs $20 for children ages 4-12 and $28 for adults. It features toy-themed play areas for small children who, the company hopes, will bug their parents to buy them merchandise associated with the fun zones they've just finished exploring. \\nThese pop-up playlands aren't permanent stores. After about six months they will set up shop somewhere else.\\nGoodman, who previously served as CEO of The Gap (GPS), Kmart, and Sears, used a similar blueprint to help Candytopia founder Jackie Sorkin turn her birthday party and event business into a multi-million dollar, confection-themed touring attraction celebrated by celebrity influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore.\\nToys \"R\" Adventure's first run in Chicago and Atlanta generated national headlines last week as families celebrated the return of the familiar retail brand.  Pictures and videos of smiling, laughing children walking through imitation snow caves and interacting with the Toys \"R\" Us mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, are circulating now on Instagram and Facebook.\\nThe Toys \"R\" Us Adventure in Atlanta's Lenox Marketplace shopping complex was nearly filled to capacity, Goodman said. \\n\"We feel like we're adding a service to the mall in terms of driving additional traffic, anything from 1,700 to 2,200 people every single day,\" Goodman told CNN Business. \"It's like the circus. The circus comes to town and the circus leaves. It may or may not be back in a couple of years. That's how our model is built.\"\\nThis idea isn't exactly new, but it is catching on elsewhere. The minds behind New Jersey's new American Dream mall, which opened on Friday, came up with a similar concept. The Rutherford, New Jersey shopping complex is less a place to buy consumer goods and more of an indoor theme park with cartoon-themed attractions in its Nickelodeon Universe. It also has an indoor ski slope, a water park, and an NHL regulation-sized ice rink.\\nScott Webb, CEO of the digital consulting firm Avionos, says this may be the future of toy-related, brick-and-mortar retail shopping. Encouraging kids to play with toys that aren't tied to TV, movie, or video game characters is crucial for the industry, which has struggled in an era when children binge watching shows on streaming services often avoid commercials advertising toys that they won't see on their favorite shows.\\n\"Kids as much as anything are digital consumers now,\" Webb told CNN Business. \"The Hasbro numbers back this up. The segments of toys that have really thrived are those tied to some intellectual property, whether it's Fortnite or Marvel or Star Wars.\" \\nWebb said Toys \"R\" Us turning its company into a toy discovery brand as opposed to a retailer may be a good strategy. \"I think they absolutely have a lot of brand equity to carve out a new niche in that role,\" he continued. \"But I think it would be hard to predict them ever discovering the same dominance in retail.\"\\n   \n",

And workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is expensive for grocers. That's why grocers are looking to technology to reduce costs and keep aisles from jamming up.\\n'Micro-fulfillment centers' \\nAlbertsons and Stop & Shop are testing automated \"micro-fulfillment centers\" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.\\nStop & Shop, owned by Dutch parent Ahold Delhaize, is building a 12,000-square-foot fully automated fulfillment center in the backroom of a store in Windsor, Connecticut, for deliveries in the Hartford area. Stop & Shop offers delivery through its online Peapod service.\\nMeijer announced this month that it will also begin testing micro-fulfillment with a logistics company to \"maximize space in our stores\" and expand online options, said Sid Handa, the company's director of strategic supply chain initiatives.\\nAnd in Salem, New Hampshire, Walmart is piloting a system with autonomous carts that gather customers' grocery orders and bring them to Walmart workers, who then prepare them for delivery or pickup.\\nSome analysts say these models are an advantage over large, centralized warehouses, which are often located further away from customers than stores. That's why micro-fulfillment centers can save grocers in delivery costs, according to experts.\\n\"Micro-fulfillment helps retailers solve the labor and last-mile costs conundrum,\" Christopher Mandeville, analyst at Jefferies, said in a research report earlier this month. \\nMandeville estimates that the cost of delivering groceries from central warehouses is usually around two times higher than using micro-fulfillment in stores. Jefferies cut Kroger's stock earlier this month in part because the company has invested in centralized facilities through a deal with Ocado, instead of micro-fulfillment.\\nGrocers are also moving the picking process out of stores entirely and testing so-called dark stores. Some dark stores have automation, while others are still manned by employees to do all of the picking of goods purchased online, said Mandeville.\\n\"Dark stores in grocery are an emerging trend,\" said Michael Demko, founder of grocery consulting firm Locai Solutions.\\nWalmart recently opened Walmart Pickup Point, a 40,000-square-foot prototype outside of Chicago at a former Dominick's grocery store. Customers drive up to the site to designated parking spots, and a Walmart worker loads up their trunk with their order. Walmart can also make deliveries from the location. \\nThe inside of the location looks like a Walmart with groceries and everyday items. Unlike a traditional Walmart supercenter, however, customers won't be able go inside.\\nStop & Shop has an approximately 40,000-square-foot dark store in Whitman, Massachusetts, on the site of a former grocery store tailored to make deliveries.\\nAnd Hy-Vee, based in Iowa, is testing four dark stores. The inside looks similar to a store but without signs, according to a spokesperson for the company.\\nThe locations are designed to fill shoppers' online orders while allowing traditional stores to \"continue to serve the needs of those who enjoy the in-store experience,\" the Hy-Vee spokesperson said.\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of Stop & Shop's 'dark store' in Massachusetts.\\n   \n",

(WIAT) — Liz Landgren has always loved to draw and paint, but she never realized she had a gift until adulthood. \\n“[I realized] it can be something that I can use for all kinds of things,” Landgren said.\\nThroughout her career, she’s painted all sorts of figures and creatures. But to her, no painting has ever been as important as her most recent piece: a portrait of Aniah Blanchard, the 19-year-old Southern Union student who has been missing for over a week. \\nAs she describes it, this painting had a mission.\\n“I thought ‘what can I do to make people look twice and look and see Aniah?'” she said.\\nAnd people have. \\nThe painting of Blanchard, a Homewood native, was the final product of a time-lapse video she made showing the process start to finish with fastidious attention paid to every detail. \\n\\nMISSING – Aniah Blanchard, from Homewood Alabama, went missing from AUBURN on Wednesday night. I’m hoping that this time…Posted by Liz DeFuniak Landgren on Monday, October 28, 2019\\n\\n“I’ve memorized the shape of her face, the shape of her eyes,” she said. “It’s just a way to take that second glance.”\\nThe video has been viewed over 30,000 times and the original painting has been gifted to Blanchard’s family. Before the investigation began, Landgren says she didn’t know them personally, but that didn’t stop her from wanting to help. \\n“I don’t know, it’s just hit me so hard,” Landgren said with tears in her eyes. “She is one of our children. If this were my child, what would I want people to be doing? Everything. We’ve gotta find her. We’ve gotta find her. “\\nLangren said the community is welcome to download and share the Blanchard portrait across social media.\\n\\nThe investigation is ongoing and anyone with information regarding Aniah’s whereabouts, or other knowledge about the case is asked to call the Auburn Police Division Detective Section at 334-501-3140, the anonymous tip line at 334-246-1391 or the 24 hour non-emergency number at 334-501-3100. \\n\\nLATEST POSTS\\n‘Enough is enough’: Stop the Violence Conference held in Birmingham\\nPresident Trump declares November National Veterans and Military Families Month\\nTexas search group joins effort to find Aniah Blanchard\\nNix, No. 11 Auburn hold on, 20-14 over Ole Miss\\nNew Alabama Democratic Party chair elected after infighting\\n\\n\\n   \n",

Some experts believe it's because Closs is white and Fitts is black.\\nIn fact, data shows that missing white children receive far more media coverage than missing black and brown children, despite higher rates of missing children among communities of color.\\nThe FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database lists 424,066 missing children under 18 in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. About 37 percent of those children are black, even though black children only make up about 14 percent of all children in the United States.\\nIt's harder to say how many Hispanic kids are missing. The FBI's report groups white and Hispanic children together. Based on other reports, about 20 percent of missing children are Hispanic or Latino, according to Robert Lowery, vice president of the missing child division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). But the real number, he said, is likely higher.\\n\"I think there's a false belief that white children make up the biggest number of missing children when in fact (proportionally) it's just the opposite,\" Lowery said, adding that the high number of black girls reported missing is particularly concerning.\\nHere are some reasons experts say we don't hear more about missing children of color:\\nTheir families are hesitant to call police\\nSome families are hesitant to contact law enforcement, even if they think their child is missing.\\n\"There's a sense of distrust between law enforcement and the minority community,\" said Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation.\\nThat distrust contributes to a \"silent code of 'no snitching,'\" Wilson said, adding that it is important for people who suspect a child is missing to speak up.\\n\"It could be your child, your mother, your father that's missing,\" she said. \"You would want someone to speak up to help find them.\"\\nOther families might not report that their child is missing because they fear it could have unintended, negative consequences. \\nFor example, Lowery suspects missing Latino children are underreported because some families with undocumented members might not contact police for fear of being deported. \\nThey don't get as much media coverage\\nNews media organizations have often been criticized for not giving missing black children the amount of attention they give missing white kids. \\nA 2010 study found that black children were significantly underrepresented in TV news. Even though about a third of all missing children in the FBI's database were black, they only made up about 20 percent of the missing children cases covered in the news. \\nA 2015 study was bleaker: though black children accounted for about 35% of missing children cases in the FBI's database, they amounted to only 7% of media references.\\nExperts say media coverage is vital to helping solve those cases.\\n\"It puts law enforcement on alert, and they add additional resources to the case,\" Wilson said. \"If no one knows about it, then no one's doing anything to find them or to help them get the assistance they need.\"\\nFamilies don't have the resources\\nFamilies don't always have the financial resources to respond appropriately when their child is missing. They might not be able to afford a private investigator or take off from work to help look for their child and follow up with law enforcement and the media. \\nAnd in some cases, they may not know what to do.\\nWilson said some people are under the misconception that they must wait 48 hours before filing a police report, when that waiting period varies by location. Places like Illinois or Washington, DC, don't have waiting periods to report a child missing.\\nKnowing the laws in your state helps. And when in doubt, contact law enforcement immediately. \\nThere are other resources that families can utilize as well.\\nThe Black and Missing Foundation helps families of color file police reports, create missing posters and spread the word about missing children.\\nFacebook groups offer an online community for parents to alert the public about their missing child and ask questions of others who have had similar experiences. \\nEliseo Montoya, who runs the Facebook group Runaway and Missing Children in California, said he keeps the page going because it allows families to feel like they're doing something even when it seems like authorities are giving up. \\n\"A page like mine is very important for people of color because nobody really embraces people of color,\" Montoya said.\\nSome get classified as runaways\\nWhen most people think of missing children, they think of young children abducted by strangers. But missing children can refer to kids who are abducted by relatives or children who leave home, either voluntarily or after being lured by someone else.\\nMany missing children of color are classified as runaways, Wilson said. And while running away from home isn't a problem unique to nonwhite children, they are particularly vulnerable. \\nA significant number of nonwhite children who go missing are either homeless or in foster care, said Wilson, and many are at risk for sex trafficking. Data shows black children are overrepresented in foster care and are at a much higher risk for homelessness. \\nLaw enforcement often classify children of color as runaways without having all the details, Wilson said. Because those kids are considered to have voluntarily left home, Amber alerts aren't sent out about them and they typically aren't covered in the news. \\nRunaway cases and abductions by family members don't get the same attention that abductions by non-family members or strangers do. But all these scenarios fall under the \"missing\" umbrella. A child is missing if they are under the age of 18 and their legal guardian doesn't know where they are.\\nThe NCMEC no longer distinguishes between runaways and abductions on their posters of missing children.\\n\"Frankly, we were dealing with a desensitized public and media when we did that,\" Lowery said. \"Now if you check our website, our children are just listed as missing child.\"\\nWilson stressed that runaway cases should be treated with the same urgency.\\n\"We have to be mindful,\" she said. \"What did they leave from, and what are they ultimately running to?\"\\nSometimes, children of color get classified as runaways when they are truly missing. Wilson said her organization has seen many such cases. \\n\"We tell parents all the time, you know your child better than anyone else, their behavior, their characteristics,\" she said. \"If you believe your child did not run away, you just have to stand firm with law enforcement and let them know that this is uncharacteristic of your child.\" \\n   \n",

Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?\\nThe answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.\\nConsider what we've seen just since Friday:\\n1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card\\n2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown\\n3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him \\n4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House\\n5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy\\n6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened \\n7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails\\nAnd in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.\\nThe rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.\\nAt one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)\\nAnd the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the \"same old, same old,\" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.\\nFrom a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  \\nBut by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of \"alternative facts.\" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.\\nEven for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.\\nNow consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.\\nThe real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?\\n   \n",

acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney testify on Capitol Hill on Friday, ratcheting up their investigation to target the President's top aide.\\nThe House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees sent Mulvaney a letter Tuesday requesting he appear for a closed-door deposition as part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. \\n\"We believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the House's impeachment inquiry,\" the Democratic chairs wrote.\\nIt appears unlikely that Mulvaney will comply with the request. \\nSo far this week, six Trump administration officials have defied requests for their testimony, and several more are expected to do the same later this week, including Energy

Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.\\nWilliams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.\\nPence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.\\nLawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.\\nOver a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.\\nSince then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.\\nThe three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is \"expected\" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nCurrent and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: \"She is the most professional person in this building.\"\\nThe official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces.

That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. \\nKentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. \\nYet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. \\nIf Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. \\nThe same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. \\nThe polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. \\nYou can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. \\nHood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. \\nAfter the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. \\nIf there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. \\nThose slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. \\nWere Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.\\nI would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  \\nStill, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that \"all politics is becoming increasingly national.\"\\n   \n",

The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. \\nAll eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates.\\nHere's a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: \\nKentucky governor \\nRepublican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state's attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   \\nTrump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor's office in the state. \\nTrump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin's victory came within 10 points of his opponent.\\nMedicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.\\nIn 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.\\nBeshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. \\nPolls close at 6 p.m. local time. \\nMississippi governor\\nMississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  \\nTrump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  \\nCook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from \"likely Republican\" to \"leans Republican,\" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.\\nHood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. \\nThere is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.\\nVice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.\\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. \\nVirginia legislature \\nRepublicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.\\nDemocrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\\nDemocrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.\\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.\\nPolls close at 7 p.m. ET.\\n   \n",

And now it's the President who is leading the attack. \\n\"There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,\" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. \"If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump.\" \\nHe's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have \"the right to confront your accuser.\"\\nBut the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. \\nThere are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.\\nWhen that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. \"This is unique,\" Kohn said. \"The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.\"\\nKohn added: \"If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.\"\\nAnd Trump has made clear where he stands. \\nHe wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?\\n\"It's a gray area,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the \"same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.\"\\nBut certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal \"that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.\"\\nThe whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.\\nHarassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.\\n\"The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,\" he said.\\nDevine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.\\nHe ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.\\nBut that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. \"The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,\" he told the Guardian in 2016.\\nAnd then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. \"The law protects the whistleblower,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. \"I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.\"\\nBut no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.\\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. \\n\"If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,\" Toobin said on CNN Monday. \"The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.\"\\nToobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower \"pure harassment\" and a \"sideshow\" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.\\n\"This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,\" said Toobin. \"That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.\"\\nBut that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.\\nUltimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.\\n   \n",

They are also alleged to have aided Giuliani, the President's personal attorney, in efforts to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\\nThe video of the rally is the latest example of how the pair who had little record of donations to candidates before 2018, wielded their proximity to Giuliani and used political donations to gain access to the president and political campaigns. Photos and videos throughout 2018 and 2019 show the pair traveling with the former New York City mayor throughout the world and to political events across the country.\\nThe footage was found by CNN's KFile during a review of the travel and political activity of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman.\\nParnas and Fruman were arrested in October attempting to leave the country. They were indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to violate the ban on foreign donations to federal and state elections, making false statements and falsifying records to the Federal Election Commission. They pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week to the charges. Parnas and Fruman were ordered to house confinement and subject to GPS monitoring after they each secured a $1 million bond. \\nIn the videos, Parnas sits in the area directly behind Trump before and during the rally.  Parnas, who at times is wearing a blue hat and glasses, can be seen apparently taking a video of the President on his cellphone as he walks up the stairs to the stage.\\nAt another point, Parnas leaves the area behind the podium to be along the path of the Trump's exit at the bottom of the stage. He waves to the president as he leaves, and the president waves back in the direction of Parnas and the crowd.\\nIt is unclear how Parnas, who is not a Nevada native, got into the prized seating area directly behind the President. A photo from Parnas' Instagram featured in a video by the Wall Street Journal shows he appeared to have a VIP badge for the event.\\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman since their indictment.\\n\"I don't know those gentlemen,\" the President said earlier this month. \"Now it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody, I have a picture with everybody here.\"\\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump added. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do but I don't know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy, I just don't know.\"\\nNeither Parnas nor Fruman returned a request for comment. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. A lawyer for Fruman did not return a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. \\nRally mentioned in indictments\\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York described the October 2018 rally in the 21-page indictment of Parnas, Fruman and their associates David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were both indicted on a conspiracy charge. Correia and Kukushkin have also pleaded not guilty.\\nThe prosecutors wrote that \"on or about October 20, 2018,\" Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for \"Candidate-1\" in Nevada and took photos with \"Candidate-2.\" The trio then sent the photographs to \"Foreign National-1,\" whose identity has not yet been confirmed.\\nThe candidates were later identified as Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt and attorney general candidate Wesley Duncan. Trump appeared at the rally to campaign for Laxalt. A photo from Parnas' now-private Instagram, a screenshot of which can be seen in a video posted by the Wall Street Journal, shows him and Fruman posing for a photograph with Laxalt previously during a September 2018 fundraiser. A spokesperson for Laxalt told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he \"doesn't know the man.\"\\nOne of several midterm events attended by Parnas and Fruman  \\nThe Trump rally in Nevada was one of many events attended by Fruman and Parnas in the final weeks heading up the November 2018 midterm elections.\\nIn photos posted on Twitter, Parnas and Fruman can be seen accompanying Giuliani to events in Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Indiana and again in Nevada.\\nA November 3, 2018, tweet of a several photos from Michigan Senate candidate John James shows James sitting at a table with Giuliani and Parnas. In another photo, James can be seen speaking while Fruman sits in the first row of seats and Parnas stand with Giuliani off to the side. \\nPictures tweeted that same day from Giuliani and congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian show Giuliani with Parnas and Fruman while campaigning in Nevada. A video from that morning also shows Fruman and Parnas with Giuliani as he campaigns in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun.\\nAnother campaign event for then-Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on November 4, 2018, shows Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman among attendees according to photos shared from DeSantis's Twitter account.\\nParnas was also seen with Giuliani at campaign events for New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Eddie Edwards. Photos posted on Twitter show Edwards and Giuliani addressing supporters at several campaign events on November 5, 2018 -- the day before the midterm election -- with Parnas standing near Giuliani.\\n   \n",

                                     (CNN)A new survey of likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers from the New York Times and Siena College finds a tight top tier of four in Iowa, with no clear leader in the first state to weigh in on the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\nIn Friday's poll, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has the support of 22%, with a tight cluster of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (19%), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and Former Vice President Joe Biden (17%) all within striking distance of Warren.\\nThe results in the early voting state do not bode well for Biden and are similar to a September CNN/Des Moines Regiser/Mediacom poll in which Warren challenged Biden's dominance in the race. \\nThis also marks a jump for Buttigieg, who previously lagged behind the three longstanding frontrunners and clocked in at 9% in CNN's poll in Iowa last month.\\nBehind them, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar lands at 4%, and California Sen. Kamala Harris and businessman Andrew Yang at 3% each in Friday's poll. The poll is Klobuchar's second poll that meets the standard to qualify for the December Democratic presidential debate, which requires 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC's criteria or 6% in two early state polls between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12.\\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Tom Steyer all garnered 2% of support.\\nTwo-thirds of likely caucusgoers in the poll said they could still change their minds about whom to support.\\nThe Times/Siena survey was conducted from Oct. 25-30, questioned 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\\n   \n",

                              Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's campaign says House Democrats' vote to formally launch an impeachment inquiry has only emboldened the President's supporters and bolstered their campaign contributions. \\n\"Nancy Pelosi's impeachment resolution day turned into a MASSIVE fundraising day for ??@realDonaldTrump?,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Friday morning. \\nAccording to Parscale, the campaign raised $3 million online in one day, totaling $19 million in funds raised over the course of the month. \\nThe $3 million addition came the same day the House passed the resolution, which the campaign called a \"sham.\" \\n\"Today's vote merely proves that the entire impeachment process was a sham from the beginning and Nancy Pelosi can't legitimize it after the fact,\" Parscale said in a statement following the resolution vote. \"Voters will punish Democrats who support this farce and President Trump will be easily re-elected.\"\\nTrump's one-day haul highlights his campaign's heavy use of digital advertising to reach potential supporters and donors -- a year ahead of the 2020 election.\\nThe campaign's heaviest spending isn't in swing states, such as Michigan or Pennsylvania, but in donor-rich parts of the country, such as Texas and California, according to a CNN tally of Facebook advertising data compiled by the Democratic-leaning firm Bully Pulpit Interactive.\\nThe Lone Star State received the biggest share of Facebook spending by the Trump campaign and its affiliated Trump Make America Great Again Committee since late March of this year -- nearly 9% of its total spending on the platform, the data show.\\nThe fundraising bump also came during the final days of the month, a period when nearly all active political campaigns rally supporters to ramp up contributions ahead of the close of the monthly report to the Federal Election Commission. The campaign push, in the final week of this month, included offers to triple and even quintuple all donations.  \\nThe Trump campaign has been positioning itself this fall to be ready to capitalize on Trump's perceived accomplishments and political battles. \\nDuring the final game of the World Series earlier this week, the campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy, airing a video nationally which checked off the President's accomplishments and went after his Washington rivals. It focuses on Trump's efforts to combat ISIS and boost the economy, and it also highlights his battles with Democrats and the Russia investigation.\\nOn Friday, a day after the House vote, Facebook ads from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee asked supporters to \"add your name\" to the people willing to \"Stand with President Trump\" in the face of the impeachment inquiry.\\nSupporters then are encouraged to leave their names, email addresses, ZIP codes and mobile numbers.\\nIn a recent conference call with reporters, a Trump official called the reelection effort a \"digital first campaign\" that can swiftly seize on fast-moving news, such as developments in the impeachment inquiry, to target voters and test and tweak advertising messages on digital platforms.\\n\"They are running a highly sophisticated operation,\" Reid Vineis, vice president for digital at Republican ad-buying firm Majority Strategies, said of the Trump operation. \"The Trump campaign has been essentially building a database for the 2020 general election.\"\\nOf particular value: The campaign's collection of mobile phone numbers.\\n\"Politics is much more effective at a one-to-one level,\" Vineis said. \"Text messages are read almost 100% of the time.

Now the results of a recent trial at Microsoft (MSFT) suggest it could work even for the biggest businesses.\\nThe company introduced a program this summer in Japan called the \"Work Life Choice Challenge,\" which shut down its offices every Friday in August and gave all employees an extra day off each week.\\nThe results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year, the company said in a statement last week. \\nIn addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails. \\nThey suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft's, of course).\\nThe effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft's 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company. \\nBy shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity. \\nThe initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — culture of overwork. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: karoshi means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.\\nThe issue attracted international attention in 2015, when an employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu committed suicide on Christmas Day. Tokyo officials later said that the staffer had worked excessive amounts of overtime.\\nTwo years later, a reporter at a Japanese broadcaster died after working punishing long hours. Her employer said she had clocked in 159 hours of overtime the month before her death.\\nThat has led businesses to start searching for solutions. Some companies have begun offering employees more flexibility, and the government has launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday,\" which encourages workers to leave early every last Friday of the month.\\nMicrosoft, for its part, says it will conduct another experiment in Japan later this year. It plans to ask employees to come up with new measures to improve work-life balance and efficiency, and will also ask other companies to join the initiative.\\n   \n",

Plans for the store were announced in September.\\nThe new location is one answer to what Starbucks (SBUX) envisions as the third place between work and home, according to Kathryn Young, the company's vice president of urban markets. She told CNN Business that customers want \"convenience, comfort and connection\" and the pick-up store is designed specifically around the first of those. \\nYoung said the store is meant to be \"predictable and effortless\" for customers who want seamless beverage or food pick-up in their busy lives. \\nThe store is around 1,000 square feet, nearly half the size of a regular cafe's 1,800 square feet. It does not have the large seating areas or cases of food in a typical Starbucks, although a full menu will be offered. \\nThe design is also brighter and more modern than Starbucks' cozier coffee shop aesthetic. A large digital signage board will tell people the status of their order.\\nCustomers aren't required to order from Starbucks' app, but they are encouraged to do so. Baristas will still take orders, and assist customers in downloading and using the app. \\nThe digitally focused store is part of the company's goal to encourage customers to join its app-based rewards program. The number of Starbucks Rewards members grew 15% over the past year to 17.6 million, the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday. Rewards customers spend more than a typical customer. \\nStarbucks Pick-Up will help the company \"test and learn\" the format, Young said, which it could expand to other US cities.\\nThe new format may help Starbucks prevent cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another Starbucks nearby. That's a problem in dense urban areas such as New York City. In cities with high rent costs, the company can open these lower-rent, smaller stores instead of higher-rent, larger cafes, offering a different experience while still maintaining brand loyalty. \\nStarbucks has a variation of its pick-up store in China, which is called Starbucks Now. Customers can order ahead and pick up their drinks in a sleek store. It's similar to Luckin Coffee (LK), a rapidly growing regional rival that places heavy emphasis on digital orders and transactions. \\nCEO Kevin Johnson said on Starbucks' earnings call this week that it's \"seeing encouraging early results\" from Starbucks Now and plans to open more of them across China's largest cities. \\nBoth Starbucks Now and Starbucks Pick-Up are part of the company's portfolio of stores that are \"tuned to different needs at different times,\" Young said. \\nOn the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Starbucks'  Roastery, its massive and glitzy destination for coffee afficionados. The world's largest Starbucks Roastery is scheduled to open in mid-November. The four-story Chicago location is 43,000 square feet and is replacing a former Crate and Barrel location on the city's Magnificent Mile.\\n   \n",

But it took very little time for me to realize the AirPods Pro are not necessarily harder to lose than their less expensive sibling. At $90 more than Apple's starting model, you'll be that much sadder when they end up on train tracks or mysteriously disappear into a couch cushion, never to be seen again. It costs $89 for a replacement earpiece ($29 with Apple Care).\\nThe fact that many people, myself included, still flock to buy up these pricey, easily misplaced wireless earbuds highlights just how appealing they are. Apple's original AirPods have emerged as a surprise status symbol and a runaway hit at a time when Apple desperately needed one to offset an ongoing decline in iPhone sales. Now Apple hopes to build on this success with a new luxury version of an already luxurious product. \\nIn a sense, this is Apple (AAPL) doing what it does best: rolling out a premium version of its most popular products. The company has used this same playbook with Macs, iPhones and iPads -- and it already seems to be working with AirPods. On Wednesday morning, I saw a long line of people waiting at the Grand Central Apple Store in New York for the new AirPods Pro, the way customers famously once did for the latest iPhones. \\nApple builds on a surprise hit product\\nAlmost no one would have predicted this back in 2016 when AirPods first launched. The devices originally inspired an onslaught of memes, mocked by many who suggested they looked like electronic toothbrushes dangling from ears. But the earbuds proved to be so popular they were emulated by knock-off fashion companies and copied by a number of Apple's rivals. It's a product so easily spotted on ears in gyms and on streets that it's become, in its way, a public symbol of Apple's product lineup in the post-Steve Jobs era.\\n Apple hasn't shared how many AirPods it's sold, but the company's wearables segment, which includes AirPods, is growing fast. In the most recent quarter, this segment generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue, a 54% spike from the prior year. And when Apple calls AirPods the best selling headphones in the world, it's hard not to believe it. \\nNow the earbuds have been completely redesigned, with a vent to alleviate some of the pressure that noise-cancellation silicone tips typically add, as well as two microphones to better hear or block out background noise. They also have shorter, stubbier stems, making the older versions look even longer and more odd-looking than ever.\\nThe top-end AirPods feature the same H1 headphone chip used in the second version of AirPods, announced earlier this year, which enabled Siri capabilities to increase the volume, answer a call or pull up directions with voice commands. But now it allows more physical commands, although it's tricky to remember what exactly one versus two squeezes will do.\\nThe biggest draw to the Pro earbuds is noise cancellation -- a feature that impressively drowned out sirens and traffic during my busy commute. The change is dramatic; it's like shoving everyone at a party into a closet so you can better hear the DJ. \\nFor those moments when you don't want to block out the world, perhaps when waiting for an announcement at the airport or ordering a coffee at Starbucks, transparency mode lets you clearly hear background noise and other people's voices without sacrificing what you're listening to. At the same time, Apple says the internal software continuously adapts the sound based on the individual's ear canal's shape and length, and the surrounding noise levels.\\nThe AirPods Pro box comes with three interchangeable silicone tips (small, medium and large) to enable noise cancellation. These tips are not new to earbuds, but they are new to Apple, which has until now only offered an all-hard-plastic earbud. \\nLike fingerprints, no two ears are the same. A new comfort test, conducted through the Control Center in iOS, revealed that my left ear requires a medium tip and my right ear requires a large tip. While this mix has proven comfortable and relatively secure, minus the time one escaped my ear, it's still unclear what learning this new fun fact about myself has done to my self esteem. \\nNot perfect, but appealing for many\\nAlthough AirPods Pro are rich in sound quality and range when it comes to songs and videos, placing calls is another story: In a series of tests, I was told my voice through the device sounded grainy, like I was using speaker phone or a Bluetooth speaker in a car. \\nGetting a handle on the various touch modes takes some time, too. By squeezing the surface once, you can play, pause or answer a call. Doing so twice will let you skip a song. It took me a few minutes to teach myself what each action does. I still often get it wrong.\\nIn an earnings conference call on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he anticipates existing AirPods owners to be among the first to buy the Pro model. Judging by how many people waiting in line to buy a Pro set already had AirPods outside an Apple Store in Manhattan on Wednesday, I'd argue he's right.

Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. \\nHere's what Paul said:\\n\"We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'\"\\nPaul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. \"The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!\"\\nWhile that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)\\nWhat Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!\\nThat's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.\\nHere's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.\\nThe task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.\\nTo date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.\\nFixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.\\nBut thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.\\nWhat Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).\\nIt's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.\\nTo which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.\\n   \n",

Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?\\nI asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\nCillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?\\nBailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.\\nBevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.\\nGoforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.\\nAttorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.\\nCillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?\\nBailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.\\nBut there are some clear differences between the two. \\nThe President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.\\nBevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.\\nCillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?\\nBailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.\\nAndy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.\\nHe also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.\\nCillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?\\nBailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________.\" Now explain.\\nBailey: \"Donald Trump.\"\\nThe President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.\\nTrump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.\\n   \n",

You're reading the wrong polls,\" Trump responded to questions from reporters about new numbers from CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post/ABC among others. \"You're read- -- let me just tell you, I have the real polls. I have the real polls. The CNN polls are fake. The Fox polls have always been lousy. I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.\"\\nThat response from the President begs the question: Where are these \"real\" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)\\nA bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.\\nOn Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: \\n\"If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!\".\\nAnd then there was this from McDaniel late last week: \\n\"Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.\"\\nPresumably, the \"real\" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.\\nWhich is fine! And smart!\\n(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)\\nBut if Trump is going to insist that he has \"real\" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? \\nThink of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.\\nThat's not to say Trump's \"real\" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.\\nAnd honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?\\nWhy haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.\\nNo matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.\\n   \n",

Hampshire and South Carolina as he fights to keep his campaign afloat, a Castro aide tells CNN.\\nThe teams in the two early nominating states were told they were being let go on Monday. Their last days at work will be next week, the aide said.\\nThis comes after CNN first reported on Saturday that the Castro campaign was looking to downsize, supporting staffers looking for other jobs and pivoting their focus to Iowa, Nevada and Texas.\\n\"In pushing to keep Secretary Castro's critical voice in this race, our campaign, like many others, will make adjustments in staffing and resources,\" Hackett said, in response to a story first reported by Politico. \"This race is shifting as we speak, and Julián will continue to be fearless and defy expectations by making the most of our resources.\"\\nSome Castro aides outside of New Hampshire and South Carolina have taken the campaign up on that offer and other campaigns have received inquiries from would-be former Castro aides.\\nAll of this is a bid to keep Castro's campaign solvent as the former Housing and Urban Development secretary works to qualify for the November debate, something he has yet to do.\\nCastro has struggled for months to raise money or get attention in the still large field of Democrats vying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.\\nBut the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.\\nCastro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.\\n   \n",

said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are \"legally invalid\" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.\\nThe guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.\\nImpeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.\\nIn the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.\\nThe five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.\\nOLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.\\nThe administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.\\nThe memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.\\n   \n",

Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\\n\"I say to tonight to the media: do your job and print his name,\" Paul, a Kentucky Republican, yelled during a rally Trump held in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin ahead of Tuesday's gubernatorial election. The crowd of Trump supporters, many donning \"READ THE TRANSCRIPT\" shirts, erupted into applause and cheers, and some chanted \"Do your job!\" and pointed toward the area where members of the press gathered to cover the event.\\nPaul told the crowd \"we also now know the name of the whistleblower,\" but did not provide any personal knowledge of the person's identity, before going on to echo baseless claims of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \"The whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,\" Paul said. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\\nSeveral other Republicans have called for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator's insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.\\nDuring the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to \"step up\" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\nThe anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.\\nOn Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to \"expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.\"  \\nZaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.\\nIn September, the President said in a tweet, \"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,\" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.\\nTwo sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.\\n'Deeply troubling and disappointing' \\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.\\n\"I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,\" King said. \\n\"It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,\" he said. \\nLater on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's \"very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.\"\\nRaskin argued that the \"attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic\" that is a \"distraction from the merits of the case.\"\\n   \n",

But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. \\nTalks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. \\nThat room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.\\nAnd, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.\\n\"I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.\\nSenate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.\\nSchumer's office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House's impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.\\nSchumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue \"unimpeded;\" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate \"can and should\" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.\\nSchumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.\\nA key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.\\nDuring the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.\\nThere is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections. Both were in the Senate for Clinton's trial in January and February of 1999. Frequent Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a congressman from South Carolina, was also one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment. \\n   \n",

They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. \\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \"perfect.\" He claimed that the \"many people\" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.\\nThen he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.\\nBreaking down Trump's comments\\nHere is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: \\n\"And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.\"\\nGot that?\\nLet's break it down claim by claim.\\n1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.\\n2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.\\n3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.\\n4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are \"Never Trumpers.\"\\nIn summary: Trump went from\\nA) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to\\nB) acknowledging people complained about his actions to\\nC) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to \\nD) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.\\nHe can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:\\nA fact check\\nAs Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that \"nobody\" who listened to the call had a problem with it.\\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: \"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\" \\nThe Washington Post reported that \"at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after\" the call; \"concerns soared in the call's aftermath,\" the Post reported officials said, and \"within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.\"\\nThe whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information \"were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\" \\nThe White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  \\nTrump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a \"Never Trumper\" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a \"Never Trumper,\" Trump said Sunday, \"We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?\"\\nIt was not clear who Trump was calling \"you\" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call \"only came forward when you asked.\" Vindman said he was testifying \"voluntarily\" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.\\n   \n",
