Attorney for US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's sent the committee a three-page addition to his testimony on Monday, in which Sondland said he had remembered a September 1 conversation that occurred on the sidelines of a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he told a top aide to Zelensky that the security aid and investigations were linked.
""I now recall speaking individually with Mr. (Andriy) Yermak, where I said resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,"" Sondland said.
Sondland's new testimony, which was included in the public release of his closed-door deposition transcript on Tuesday, adds to Democrats' evidence that the President connected the freezing of US security aid to Ukraine to investigations into the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden, which cuts to the heart of their impeachment case against Trump.
The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees released deposition transcripts of Sondland and former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker on Tuesday as they shifted toward the public phase of their impeachment inquiry.
In his deposition last month, Sondland testified that he did not ultimately know why the aid to Ukraine was withheld. But he told lawmakers that efforts from the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to persuade Ukraine to open an investigation into Trump's political rivals ""kept getting more insidious"" as time went on, and he suggested Giuliani's efforts might have been illegal, according to the deposition transcript.
Sondland testified that it would be ""improper"" for Giuliani to push the Ukrainians to investigate Biden or get involved in the 2020 election. Asked if it was illegal, Sondland said: ""I'm not a lawyer, but I assume so.""
In his testimony, Volker said that the Ukrainians had asked to be put in touch with Giuliani — whose efforts have been described by other witnesses as a shadow foreign policy outside of State Department channels — because they believed ""that information flow would reach the President."" He said he was surprised and troubled by what was said on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
""It creates a problem again where all of the things that we're trying to do to advance the bilateral relationship, strengthen our support for Ukraine, strengthen the positioning against Russia is now getting sucked into a domestic political debate in the U.S., domestic political narrative that overshadows that. And I think that is extremely unfortunate for our policy with Ukraine,"" Volker said.
Still, Volker's testimony also provided Trump and his allies with fodder, as they've been pushing for it to be released publicly. Volker told lawmakers that he didn't know about any ""quid pro quo"" linking US military assistance to the announcement of Ukrainian investigations into Biden and the Democrats.
 ""You asked what conversations did I have about that quid pro quo, et cetera,"" Volker said. ""None, because I didn't know that there was a quid pro quo.""
 He testified that after learning about the holdup of US military aid, Volker worked to get the assistance resumed, and that he never believed it was linked to Trump's desire for a probe of the Bidens.
Volker also said that the Ukrainians didn't know about the holdup of military assistance until after the Trump administration stopped pressing them to announce an investigation into the Bidens. This testimony bolsters a key tenet of Trump's defense -- that there was no ""quid pro quo"" with Ukraine because the new government in Kiev was not aware that military aid was being withheld.
""To my knowledge, the news about a hold on security assistance did not get into Ukrainian Government circles, as indicated to me by the current foreign minister, then diplomatic adviser, until the end of August,"" Volker said. ""And by the time that we had that, we had dropped the idea of even looking at a statement.""
But Volker appeared to be unaware that on September 1, Sondland told Zelensky's political aide that the security aid and the announcement of a public investigation were in fact linked.
House Democrats have now released transcripts from four of the 13 closed-door deposition they've conducted thus far as Democrats shift toward public hearings in the impeachment inquiry, which could begin as soon as next week.
Volker and Sondland, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, dubbed themselves the ""three amigos"" who handled US-Ukraine policy. Text messages provided to Congress from Volker, who resigned last month from his post as the Ukraine scandal was unfolding, show his exchanges with Giuliani and senior State Department diplomats. He denied participating in any effort to dig up political dirt on Biden, but the texts revealed that he had talked to Ukrainian officials about launching politically charged investigations.
Democrats seek clarification from Sondland 
Democrats, meanwhile, have called on Sondland to clarify his testimony after he appeared behind closed doors on October 17. Sondland's initial testimony appears to have been contradicted by at least two other witnesses, according to CNN reporting and publicly released statements. At the heart of the discrepancy, which Sondland's clarification appears attempting to address, is whether Sondland ever explicitly linked US actions to requests for Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens, and whether he had dangled White House visits or US military aid as a potential quid pro quo.
In his October testimony, Sondland said the President had told him directly that ""there is no quid pro quo.""
But Sondland told the House committees that he eventually became aware that Ukraine aid was held up to entice Ukrainian corruption investigations, and eventually realized the investigation was linked to the Bidens. 
""Finally at some point I made the Biden-Burisma connection, and then the transcript was released,"" Sondland said during his testimony. He said he couldn't remember specific dates, and for some time hadn't made the connection between the Bidens and Burisma, the Ukrainian natural resources company for which Hunter Biden sat on the board.
Sondland described ""a continuum,"" beginning with a May 23 meeting and ""ending up at the end of the line when the transcript of the call came out.""
""It started as talk to Rudy, then others talk to Rudy,"" he explained. ""Corruption was mentioned. Then, as time went on— and, again, I can't nail down the dates — then let's get the Ukrainians to give a statement about corruption. And then, no, corruption isn't enough, we need to talk about the 2016 election and the Burisma investigations.""
Former US envoy illuminates key meeting 
Volker's testimony provided more detail into the May 23 meeting with Trump in which the President directed his aides to ""talk to Rudy"" about Ukraine. In that meeting, Volker and other administration officials recommended Trump schedule an Oval Office meeting with the newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But Trump was skeptical.
""They are all corrupt, they are all terrible people,"" Volker recalled Trump saying. ""I don't want to spend any time with that.""
Volker said he became aware of the hold on aid on July 18 -- before the Trump-Zelensky call -- but he did not find out the reason for the hold.
""Nobody ever gave a reason why,"" Volker said.
Volker explained that he advised the Ukrainians to drop a public announcement of an investigations into the 2016 election and Burisma after learning that the Justice Department had not requested them, despite what Giuliani was promoting.
""It died. I mean, no one—once we started seeing a tempo of engagement with Ukraine, we had first the sense that Rudy was not going to be convinced that it meant anything, and, therefore, convey a positive message to the President if it didn't say Burisma and 2016,"" Volker said. ""I agreed with the Ukrainians they shouldn't do it, and in fact told them just drop it, wait till you have your own prosecutor general in place. Let's work on substantive issues like this, security assistance and all. Let's just do that. So we dropped it.""
Volker testified that he personally told Giuliani that the source of many of those theories was ""not credible."" Giuliani has spent much of this year spreading theories about former Vice President Biden and the Democrats peddled by former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsnko.
This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 18:29:26 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/politics/donald-trump-chaos/index.html,C-H-A-O-S.," (CNN)C-H-A-O-S.
That's been the watchword of Donald Trump's presidency -- a roiling, sprawling circus of content and controversy that never slows down and never rests. Which is why it's hard to say that things are ever, somehow, more chaotic. Because what's more chaotic that utter chaos?
The answer to that question is the last five days. Because in those five days we have seen an avalanche of news, quotes and just general Trump-related content that even by the bananas standards of this administration seems like a whole new level.
Consider what we've seen just since Friday:
1. Two Trump rallies -- one in Mississippi and one in Kentucky -- filled with the now-familiar rhetorical excesses and outright lies that have become the President's calling card
2. A federal appeals court rules against Trump on taxes -- setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown
3. E. Jean Carroll, a columnist who alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, filed a defamation suit against him 
4. The Department of Justice threatened legal action against the publisher of the not-yet-released anonymous tell-all memoir of Trump in the White House
5. House Democrats began releasing transcripts of their closed-door interviews with key players in the Ukraine controversy
6. Roger Stone's trial -- into his alleged attempts to gain information about Russian hacking efforts -- opened 
7. Newly released documents from former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation made clear the Trump campaign was very focused on trying to find Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails
And in that same time frame -- Friday night at 5 p.m. through Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern -- Trump had tweeted 68 times, in addition to dozens of other retweets. He also held three press availabilities -- one each on Saturday, Sunday and Monday -- as he traveled to and from New York City and then to Kentucky.
The rate of news and the sheer quantity of words spoken or tweeted by Trump since Friday night alone are staggering. Even for people -- like me! -- who are paid to follow this stuff, the last few days have been mentally exhausting. There's just so much going on.
At one level, the chaos is the point. Trump knows that the media (and people more generally) can only focus on so many things in a given hour, day or week and so the more he throws against the wall, the harder it will be for anyone to hone in on the stories -- like impeachment -- that are less favorable to him on a day-in, day-out basis. You can't look in 10 places at once. (Trump doesn't, of course, control when House Democrats release transcripts of their interviews or when federal courts rule on things like his tax returns.)
And the more people tune out and ascribe what they are seeing in Washington as just the ""same old, same old,"" the better for Trump. His behavior is actually deeply abnormal; the pox-on-both-houses mentality helps him immeasurably as it avoids casting his actions and words for what they are: Totally ahistoric.
From a fact-checking standpoint, Trump, again, benefits from the sheer volume of news -- and the content he creates off of it. Reading through the transcripts of his campaign speeches in Mississippi Friday and Kentucky Monday, I was struck by how wildly Trump veered from both a) the truth and b) even the outer bounds of acceptable presidential behavior, which he has defined downward since he became a candidate for office.  
But by Monday morning, Trump was actively cheering on the idea of outing the whistleblower while White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway was offering up a new set of ""alternative facts."" And the transcript of the interview with former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was out. And the tax returns ruling happened.
Even for vast news organizations like CNN, it's simply not possible to give all of these stories the full attention they deserve. And, if the news flood overwhelms huge, well-staffed national news entities, what must it feel like for the average news consumer? Drinking from a firehose doesn't even come close.
Now consider this: We are still just under a year away from the November 2020 general election. And 90-ish days from the first votes of the 2020 Democratic primary process in Iowa. In short: If you think this is bad, just wait.
The real question going forward is not whether this news stream will let up (it won't) but what the political -- and psychological -- impact of this unending chaos new cycle will be. Do voters tune it out? Do they dial in (even) more? And how does the eventual Democratic nominee deal with Trump's constant content cavalcade?

Jennifer Williams would be the first person on Pence's national security team to appear and has knowledge of how much the vice president knew about the efforts by President Donald Trump and those around him to push Ukraine to launch investigations into Joe Biden and his son, as well as 2016 election interference, according to a source familiar with her thinking. 
Williams, along with other senior administration and national security officials, was listening to the phone call on July 25 in which Trump asked for a ""favor"" of his newly-elected Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, a White House source says. Trump asked Zelensky to work with his attorney general, William Barr, and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on investigations after Zelensky said he was ready to proceed with the transfer of US military aid to Ukraine.
Williams, a longtime State Department staffer, is detailed to Pence's office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the call. The other was Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president's national security adviser, who has not yet been called to testify.
Pence did not listen in, but a transcript of the call was put into Pence's daily briefing binder, an administration source says.
Lawmakers will look to Williams to explain what Pence knew and when, something the source familiar with Williams' thinking says she is able to do.
Over a month after the call, Williams traveled with Pence to Warsaw when he stood in for Trump and met with Zelensky on September 1. After that meeting, Pence said they discussed corruption in Ukraine and evaded a question about whether the hold up of almost $400 million in security aid for Ukraine was tied to Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.
Since then, Pence has insisted that Trump did nothing wrong but has not clarified how much he knew about efforts to pressure Ukraine and the parallel Ukraine policy Giuliani and others were leading outside the normal diplomatic and official channels.
The three committees leading the Democrat's inquiry say Williams is ""expected"" to testify behind closed doors and sources close to Williams say she is likely to appear. She has hired a lawyer, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Current and former colleagues have heaped praise on Williams, with one White House official saying: ""She is the most professional person in this building.""
The official noted that Williams had recently worked with Pence on negotiating the ceasefire between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces. Until Williams joined Pence's staff, she was a spokesperson for several years at the US embassy in London, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also held posts at the embassies in Beirut, Lebanon and Kingston, Jamaica.
""Jen is the type of person who I know to be dedicated to the institution above anything else,"" said Brett Bruen, the former Director of Global Engagement at the White House under President Barack Obama.
She comes from the cadre of diplomats ""who are not going to be easily intimidated or hold back information,"" Bruen added. ""She is someone who is pretty tough and has had tough assignments that have steeled her to the kind of pressure and the intimidation tactics that have been used against others.""
CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more precisely reflect Williams' role.

"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 19:33:56 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/politics/whistleblower-identity-trump-legal-obligations/index.html,There are plenty of people arguing that President Donald Trump is breaking the law by encouraging news organizations to out the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine triggered the impeachment investigation.," (CNN)There are plenty of people arguing that President Donald Trump is breaking the law by encouraging news organizations to out the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine triggered the impeachment investigation.
Here's the problem with that view: The President is the law when it comes to protecting national security whistleblowers. And now it's the President who is leading the attack. 
""There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he's the whistle-blower,"" Trump said this week, referring to reports in conservative media outlets purporting to identify the author. ""If he's the whistleblower, he has no credibility. Because he's a Brennan guy, he's a Susan Rice guy, he's an Obama guy. And he hates Trump."" 
He's been joined by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who repeated his argument to CNN on Tuesday that Trump should have ""the right to confront your accuser.""
But the whole idea behind whistleblower laws is that whistleblowers should enjoy anonymity and protections from reprisal. 
There are more than 50 whistleblower laws in the US, many of them the result of a different crisis, Stephen Kohn, a lawyer and author of The Whistleblower's Handbook. The one governing intelligence whistleblowers was passed after Edward Snowden leaked hundreds of thousands of pages of documents about data collection.
When that intelligence whistleblower law was written, it put the burden on the President to enforce it, said Kohn. ""This is unique,"" Kohn said. ""The reason they put the burden on the President was to protect critical national security secrets.""
Kohn added: ""If I'm fired for blowing the whistle on securities fraud, I can go before a judge and jury. I don't go before the President. For national security, my judge and jury is ultimately the President of the United States of America.""
And Trump has made clear where he stands. 
He wants the whistleblower named, although he hasn't gone so far as to do it himself. Would that be illegal?
""It's a gray area,"" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN analyst and former DOJ official. He added it's the ""same gray area about whether many of our laws controlling executive branch employees apply to any President.""
But certainly, according to Zeldin, the whistleblower's attorneys would immediately argue that Trump naming their client would constitute an unlawful reprisal ""that would trigger further protections for the whistleblower -- at least on paper.""
The whistleblower information page housed at the Director of National Intelligence website makes clear that a whistleblower can report harassment in his or her career up through his or her chain of command. There is the possibility for an independent review process, but it ultimately ends with the President.
Harassment for a whistleblower can be many different things, according to Tom Devine, who is legal director at the Government Accountability Project.
""The forms of harassment on the job are limited only by the imagination,"" he said.
Devine pointed to the case of Thomas Drake, a senior executive at the National Security Agency, who blew the whistle on a wasteful and invasive intelligence gathering program. The NSA disagreed and the government attempted to prosecute him as a leaker, which unlike Edward Snowden, he was not.
He ultimately pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count. The program he tried to stop was a complete failure and cost the US more than $1 billion.
But that wasn't the end of the story for Drake, who went from his top post at the NSA to working at an Apple store in suburban DC. ""The government spent many years trying to break me, and the more I resisted, the nastier they got,"" he told the Guardian in 2016.
And then, after Snowden, the law was updated -- with bipartisan support. ""The law protects the whistleblower,"" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican and a defender of whistleblowers, said on Monday afternoon. ""I'm an advocate for whistleblowing and passed all these whistleblower protection laws, so I can only say we have to go by what the law says.""
But no one foresaw the President as the direct subject of a whistleblower investigation those few short years ago.
CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says Trump has already broken the law. 
""If this were a private company, the board would fire the CEO for behaving this way towards a whistleblower,"" Toobin said on CNN Monday. ""The whole whistleblower idea is they should have protections, anonymity, much less be attacked by the President of the United States.""
Toobin called Trump's actions against the whistleblower ""pure harassment"" and a ""sideshow"" since much of what the whistleblower alleged in the original complaint has been corroborated by witnesses called by Congress in the past few weeks.
""This is one of the tests of our democracy under Donald Trump,"" said Toobin. ""That, you know, he has violated so many norms. He has violated so many laws like this one, that, you know, we -- you know, we have to decide what our priorities are.""
But that won't help the whistleblower, who the law says should have his or her anonymity protected.
Ultimately, Trump would rather focus on the whistleblower because he can attack the whistleblower. It's much more difficult to attack the growing number of witnesses who have corroborated the complaint.

As the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump deepens in Washington, voters will head to the polls a year after Democrats took the US House, testing the political landscape. 
Voters will decide the next governors of Kentucky and Mississippi, two solidly red states that voted for Trump in 2016. The President held a rally in Mississippi and will speak in Kentucky on Monday night to boost voter turnout for the two Republican candidates he endorsed. 
All eyes are on Virginia, where Democrats are fighting to flip control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats made major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, but a contested recount ended in a lottery drawing that ultimately gave Republicans control of the state House of Delegates.
Here's a breakdown of what to watch on Tuesday: 
Kentucky governor 
Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, who was elected in 2015 and is generally viewed as unpopular, is running for reelection against the state's attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear.   
Trump endorsed Bevin, and will hold a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday in a final push to encourage voters to turn out for the Republican candidate. If Bevin wins, Republicans will maintain control over the state legislature and the governor's office in the state. 
Trump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points in 2016, but in 2015, Bevin's victory came within 10 points of his opponent.
Medicaid eligibility is also an issue in Kentucky, where Bevin wants more work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Beshear wants to lift those requirements.
In 2014, Bevin ran for a seat in the US Senate but was defeated in the GOP primary by incumbent Mitch McConnell.
Beshear was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 2015, and is the son of Steve Beshear, who was the 61st governor of Kentucky, serving from 2007 to 2015. 
Polls close at 6 p.m. local time. 
Mississippi governor
Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Term limits prevented incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant from seeking reelection.  
Trump endorsed Reeves and held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo, Mississippi, ahead of Tuesday's election. The Republican Party currently controls the governor's office and majorities in both state legislative chambers in Mississippi.  
Cook Political Report recently shifted the Mississippi gubernatorial election from ""likely Republican"" to ""leans Republican,"" indicating that the race has become more competitive for a state that has voted solidly Republican in the past three presidential elections. Cook points to a combination of a tough primary runoff for Reeves and Hood's appeal to voters across the aisle as a factor in their decision. Hood is the only statewide elected Democrat in Mississippi.
Hood has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2003. Reeves has served as lieutenant governor since being elected in 2011. 
There is an unusual aspect to the state's election process. A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.
Vice President Mike Pence made an appearance at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday.
Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. 
Virginia legislature 
Republicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins.
Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.
Democrats have poured a record-breaking amount of money into the state legislature races. Virginia has long been a bellwether for national wins but has drifted left in recent years.
Earlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Republican-led Virginia House did not have the legal right to challenge a lower court opinion that struck down several district maps; the lower court had found those maps were drawn as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The ruling means the court-ordered maps that favored Democrats will continue to be used.
Polls close at 7 p.m. ET.

Voters may be casting ballots for politicians to state government, but their feelings about President Donald Trump will be paramount. That will be on full display in Tuesday's elections in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. 
Kentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin would likely be a sitting duck if Tuesday's gubernatorial election were about him. His job approval ratings have continuously been below his disapproval ratings. Even with a late rally in his approval ratings, his net approval (approval - disapproval) rating is hovering around -10 points. 
Yet, Bevin has overcome an early deficit against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear (whose father was governor). In an average of nonpartisan polls, Bevin actually runs slightly ahead of Beshear, though the race is within the margin of error. 
If Bevin does pull out the win, it will be because of Trump. The President won the state by about 30 points in 2016. His net approval rating is about +15 points in Kentucky in an average of recent polls. 
The same story seems to be holding in Mississippi. Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has been popular enough to be reelected multiple times. He was ahead in early polls of the race against Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves. 
The polling, though, has shifted in recent months. Reeves is up by about 5 points in an average of nonpartisan polls. Hood could pull it out, though it seems much less likely than at the beginning of the year. 
You can't help but think Trump's standing has something to do with Reeves gaining ground. Trump won Mississippi by about 18 points in 2016. His net approval is about +15 points, just like it is in Kentucky. 
Hood and Beshear would likely have been in much better shape if the elections were taking place last decade. They would have had an easier time escaping the partisan leans of their state. 
After the 2009 elections, about 40% of states had a governor of the opposite party that won the 2008 presidential election in a given state. Currently, about 20% of states have a governor of the opposite party that won the 2016 election in that state. 
If there is good news for Democrats on Tuesday, it's likely to come out of Virginia. All the seats in the state House and Senate are up for grabs. Republicans, including vacancies, hold a slim 20-19 seat 1-seat majority in the Senate and a 51-48 seat majority majority in the House. 
Those slim majorities are in massive trouble, however. Why? Trump's running about a -20 point net approval rating in the state. Just two years, Democrats made big gains in the state House. There's a good chance that they finish off the job tomorrow. 
Were Democrats to do well in Virginia, it could be a sign of things to come in 2020. In 2017, Democratic Virginia state House candidates won the state popular vote by a little less than 10 points. A year later, Democrats won the US House popular vote by a little less than 9 points. That is, the Virginia 2017 House results were slightly to the left of the 2018 midterm results, though still highly predictive.
I would caution reading too much into the exact margin in Virginia. We don't know if an off year really is predictive of a presidential year, even in these polarized times.  
Still, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia are likely to be an illustration that a more accurate saying now is that ""all politics is becoming increasingly national.""

Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. While Hood already faces a challenge in capturing the state's popular vote -- Cook Political Report recently labeled the race as ""leans Republican"" -- the state's unusual election process could also complicate his path to the governorship. 
A candidate needs a majority in the popular vote and needs to win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans, selects the winner.
The election process, as written in the state's constitution in 1890, was enacted at a time when white Southerners were putting in place laws to deny blacks political power. 
Critics of the system have said it ""dilutes"" the African American vote in favor of white districts and officeholders. 
A federal judge ruled Friday that the unique election process will remain in place for Tuesday's election despite a lawsuit filed earlier this year by four African American Mississippi voters against Mississippi GOP Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi GOP House Speaker Philip Gunn, accusing the state of violating the 14th and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution as well as a section of the Voting Rights Act. 
""Absent court intervention, the challenged provisions will continue to infringe upon the constitutional and statutory rights of African American voters in Mississippi, dilute African American votes and violate the one-person, one-vote principle in the upcoming general election and in every statewide election for years to come,"" the complaint submitted to a federal court in Mississippi read.
The provision increases white control because ""the vast majority of House districts have a majority-white population that can easily outvote the smaller number of highly concentrated African-American majority districts,"" the complaint said.
While Mississippi has the highest share of African Americans of any state in the country, not a single African American has won state-level, statewide office since Reconstruction.

Some of that cast of characters will re-emerge this week for Stone's trial at a federal courthouse in Washington. And new details could be revealed from what former special counsel Robert Mueller found regarding the Trump campaign and Russian influence in the 2016 election.
After investigating a number of possible crimes, prosecutors working under Mueller and the DC US attorney settled on obstruction-of-justice-related charges against Stone. This week they will aim to prove to a judge and jury that Stone lied to the House Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the election, aimed to obstruct those proceedings and also tampered with a witness. Stone has pleaded not guilty to all seven charges he is facing.
It's unclear yet whether Stone will testify in his own defense, but the last time he took the stand did not go smoothly. And it offers a hint into the dynamic between the reserved sanctity of a federal courtroom -- where no electronics are allowed and disruptions are swiftly dismissed -- and Stone's bombastic personality and efforts to stir public support for himself.
Under the big top
In February, Stone volunteered to take the stand. Judge Amy Berman Jackson was reviewing a gag order she had placed on the case, which Stone had tested by posting a photo of her on Instagram with crosshairs behind her head. Several times at the hearing, he attempted to argue his side over the judge's questioning, or grimaced and gestured broadly and licked his lips while he spoke. Jackson grew impatient with Stone's imprecise and changing answers at the time.
Ultimately, she tightened the gag order, preventing him from speaking publicly about the investigation, the case or any participants in the investigation of the case. 
In July, Jackson placed even stricter restrictions on Stone's speech, barring him from posting on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and all other forms of social media after finding he purposely tried to gain media attention while under the gag order. 
""What am I supposed to do with you? It seems as if, once again, I'm wrestling with behavior that has more to do with middle school than a court of law,"" she told the defendant.
People associated with the case have likened the upcoming trial to a ""circus"" or a ""freak show."" But they also acknowledge that Stone -- who has spent a lifetime practicing in the dark art of political warfare -- is in for the fight of his life.
""Roger faces a really uphill battle, but I have confidence in his legal team, and I am optimistic about his chances,"" said Michael Caputo, who worked on the 2016 Trump campaign and is a friend of Stone's. ""He has never faced a battle like this in his life.""
Given the high-profile nature of the case, the court has put in place several rules surrounding the trial, including blocking media interviews of trial participants inside and outside the courthouse. 
A filled courtroom and additional rooms for media and spectators are expected at the trial and cameras were already camped outside the courthouse in downtown Washington on Monday, where the parties met with the judge to discuss final trial parameters. Stone, wearing a black suit with white pocket square, declined to comment as he walked inside.
Jackson said Monday that everything was in ""excellent shape."" Jury selection in the trial gets underway Tuesday and opening statements could come as as soon as Wednesday morning. 
Among those expected to take the stand during the trial are Randy Credico, the stand-up comedian; Steve Bannon, the former White House adviser; Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign deputy chairman; and Andrew Miller, a former marijuana farmer and employee of Stone's. Mueller's team interviewed roughly a dozen of Stone's associates as they aimed to nail down whether Stone had successfully created a backchannel with WikiLeaks to obtain hacked information.
The case
Stone was arrested in January, in an unexpected pre-dawn arrest at his home in Florida, caught exclusively on camera by CNN. About a dozen officers with heavy weapons and tactical vests fanned out across Stone's lawn. 
Prosecutors' allegations against him told a scintillating story of how the Trump campaign coordinated with Stone to attempt to learn about stolen documents that, once public, could hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016. Stone communicated with the campaign about his and his associates' attempts to reach WikiLeaks, which was rolling out Democratic documents stolen by the Russians. Prosecutors say he falsely denied to the House he had discussions with the campaign and some others about trying to reach WikiLeaks. Stone has maintained he did nothing wrong -- and has even sold T-shirts saying as much. 
The trial, more than nine months after his indictment and arrest, could take two weeks or more, partly because of the amount of evidence. By March, prosecutors had turned over nine terabytes of data to Stone's defense team as part of the case, they said in court.
""We could pile it as high as the Washington Monument twice,"" Stone's attorney Robert Buschel told the judge.
Amid those piles are, apparently, evidence of phone calls made to President Donald Trump's six work and personal phone lines, and to several other key players whom Mueller investigated, including convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to a recent court filing previewing trial evidence.
Gates, Manafort's former deputy, has become a star witness at two previous trials related to the Mueller investigation, and at Stone's he could reveal some of the most tantalizing still-secret information Mueller found about the President.
According to the Mueller report, Gates told the special counsel what Trump himself had said during the 2016 campaign related to WikiLeaks and Russian hacking -- two areas Stone also allegedly focused on.
But more details about what Mueller learned are redacted in the Mueller report, labeled as secret because of potential harm to an ongoing investigation. Prosecutors have previously said that some of the redactions in the Mueller report are to comply with the court's order not to prejudice Stone's potential jurors.
Witness list
One of the prosecution's key witnesses, Credico, has expressed anxiety about his upcoming testimony even as he prepares to take the witness stand.
Stone told congressional investigators that Credico was one of his points of contact with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, a claim Credico has repeatedly denied. Credico is also the witness that Stone allegedly tried to intimidate into not cooperating with the House Intelligence Committee's investigation.
Credico and his lawyer have expressed concern about the online attacks Credico has faced from Stone's fans, particularly after prosecutors published Credico's phone number in a court filing.
A comedian, radio personality and progressive activist, Credico often exclaims that he is incapable of sticking to a script, a trait that is sure inspire heartburn in any prosecutor.
His dog, a white Coton de Tulear named Bianca, is often in tow to provide emotional support. She accompanied Credico to his interviews with Mueller's team and to his appearance before the grand jury. Bianca will be at courthouse, but it isn't clear if she will join Credico on the witness stand, according to someone familiar with the plan.
At one point, Stone allegedly threatened to steal Credico's dog, which prosecutors laid out as evidence that Stone was trying to intimidate a witness.
Credico is also central to one of the more significant tangles between prosecutors and the defense team before the trial. Stone had allegedly told Credico he should do a ""Frank Pentangeli,"" referencing a character in the film ""The Godfather: Part II"" who lied to Congress about the mafia family for which he worked. 
Prosecutors wanted to show a scene from the film in court. But Jackson said they can merely read a transcript if they see fit. 
On Monday, Stone's attorney tried to restrict the use of the movie even further, arguing that only Credico should speak to what it meant. However, Jackson stuck to her initial ruling.
Bannon, a former Breitbart News executive who worked as the chief executive officer of the Trump campaign, is another potential witness for the government 
Stone's indictment, which referred to Bannon as a ""high-ranking Trump Campaign official,"" revealed how Stone told Bannon to expect ""a load every week going forward"" from WikiLeaks just a month before Election Day 2016.
Prosecutors may not have been able to access other potentially relevant messages. The Mueller report noted that messages on Bannon's devices that predated March 2017 were missing. Bannon told investigators ""he did not know why messages did not appear on his device,"" according to the report.
Miller, an associate of Stone's who was privy for a time to some of Stone's email accounts and his schedule, has also been subpoenaed for testimony and plans to comply if he's called. Miller, a steampunk house painter from St. Louis, spent months unsuccessfully fighting his subpoena to provide information about Stone before a grand jury.
It's still unclear whether prosecutors will call yet another Stone associate, Jerome Corsi, a prolific author and conspiracy theorist, to testify. Stone pointed to Corsi as one of his backchannels to Assange, although Corsi has said he never made contact with the WikiLeaks founder.
Last year, prosecutors prepared a draft indictment against Corsi for making false statements to investigators as part of a plea deal. The draft document also alleged that Corsi deleted much of his email correspondence with Stone during the period that Stone was encouraging Corsi to get dirt from WikiLeaks.
Rather than take the plea deal, Corsi opted to share the draft indictment with the media. He later released a salacious and typo-ridden book about his experience with the Mueller team. Mueller concluded his investigation without ever bringing charges against Corsi.
But the plea agreement and other issues Mueller dug up regarding Stone's cast of potential witnesses could provide opportunities for the defense to undercut their credibility before the jury. Gates, for instance, was a shaky witness at times at Manafort's trial last year, and has pleaded guilty to his own charges and awaits his sentencing.
Some of Stone's associates that were not called as witnesses plan to attend his trial anyway. Caputo, who has not been permitted to be in contact with Stone since his arrest, said he plans to be in the courtroom as often as possible.
Kristin Davis, famously known as the ""Manhattan Madam,"" was not called to testify at Stone's trial but she still plans to attend the second week of proceedings, her spokeswoman said. She and Stone are longtime friends, and he is her son's godfather.
""I believe Stone is being persecuted because he refused to provide false testimony against the President. I look forward to the truth coming out,"" Davis told CNN last week.

"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:14:55 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/politics/trump-rand-paul-whistleblowers/index.html,"On Monday night at a campaign rally in Kentucky, home state Sen. Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine."," (CNN)On Monday night at a campaign rally in Kentucky, home state Sen. Rand Paul stood beside Donald Trump and urged the media to out the whistleblower who lodged a formal complaint against the President for conducting a pressure campaign against Ukraine. 
Here's what Paul said:
""We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name. And I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington, 'Step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!'""
Paul's pledge echoes Trump's attempts over the weekend to simultaneously discredit and out the whistleblower. ""The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff,"" Trump tweeted Monday. ""He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!""
While that sort of rhetoric might make for a good applause line at a rally, it reveals a total and complete misunderstanding of how whistleblowing works. (It's not clear to me whether this misunderstanding is willful or accidental.)
What Trump and Paul are trying to do is put the whistleblower at the end of this process. Unless the whistleblower reveals him or herself, how we can trust that anything he or she says is right? We have to know who this person is to judge whether they are some bitter Democrats or loser Never Trumper!
That's not what a whistleblower is or what they do. Whistleblowers are the start of a process, not the end of it. And they are rarely the centerpiece of the process.
Here's how things typically work as explained to me recently by National Whistleblowers Center head John Kostyack: A whistleblower comes forward and files a formal complaint. The allegations made in that complaint serve as a starting point for the investigating agency -- whether that the Securities and Exchanges Committee or, in this case, Congress.
The task of the investigators then is to run down and prove (or disprove) what's in the whistleblower's complaint. Which is what House investigators have been doing for the last few weeks -- bringing in everyone from US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, to get their accounts of what happened on not only on that fateful July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also the events of the days and week leading up to and following it.
To date, the reports (and transcripts) of those interviews have backed up the redacted whistleblower complaint released last month. And the rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, released last month by the White House. Now the investigation is moving into a more public phase with the regular release of transcripts from the closed-door interviews and a move to open interviews.
Fixating on the whistleblower in all of this, then, is missing the forest for the trees. If the only thing we had as evidence of possible wrongdoing by Trump in regard to Ukraine was the whistleblower complaint -- or even the whistleblower him or herself -- that would almost certainly be insufficient to prove much of anything. After all, the complaint acknowledges that the whistleblower wasn't on the actual call and heard much of the most concerning information second-hand.
But thanks to House investigators following the proper procedure, we now know much more than that. In the case of the July call, we have National Security Council Ukraine specialist Alexander Vindman, who was on the call, telling Congress that he thought it was inappropriate and immediately went to his supervisors to say so.
What Vindman told Congress supersedes -- but also affirms -- what the whistleblower told Congress. Vindman was on the call. And like the whistleblower, he was concerned enough about how Trump acted to do something about it. At this point, the whistleblower's account of the call is unnecessary because we know from someone on the call how it came off (at least to him).
It's not hard to see what Trump and Paul are doing here -- whether purposely or out of ignorance of how whistleblowers work. They are setting up a red herring: If the whistleblower doesn't come forward (and there are legal protections in place to make sure the whistleblower preserves their anonymity) then it's a sign that they never existed in the first place or is someone with a clear vendetta against Trump.
To which I say: Doesn't matter! Facts are facts. Either Trump and his administration said and did these things in regard to Ukraine and the possibility of investigating former vice president Joe Biden or they didn't. Who the whistleblower is matters very little at this point.

The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees sent Mulvaney a letter Tuesday requesting he appear for a closed-door deposition as part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. 
""We believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the House's impeachment inquiry,"" the Democratic chairs wrote.
It appears unlikely that Mulvaney will comply with the request. 
So far this week, six Trump administration officials have defied requests for their testimony, and several more are expected to do the same later this week, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought.
Mulvaney and the White House have already failed to respond to a subpoena from the Democrats for documents, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent House Democrats a lengthy letter arguing that the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate.

Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?"," (CNN)All eyes are on Kentucky Tuesday, as Gov. Matt Bevin (R) faces down a very serious challenge from Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic attorney general. How is it that Bevin is in such a tough race despite the heavily Republican lean of the Bluegrass State? And how much credit (or blame) does President Donald Trump deserve depending on the outcome Tuesday night?
I asked all those questions -- and more! -- of Philip M. Bailey, a political reporter for the Louisville Courier Journal. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.
Cillizza: Why is a Republican governor in a comfortably Republican state in real danger of losing today?
Bailey: Matt Bevin has broken every part of the traditional political rulebook by quarreling with members of his own party and criticizing a group that has remained a third rail in Kentucky politics: public school teachers.
Bevin's confrontational style with the press, the judiciary and other critics, even within the GOP, has hurt him in building a traditional coalition even as he was given supermajorities in the state House and state Senate. In many ways, the May primary was a wake-up call for the governor and his campaign when a freshman legislator with little name recognition beforehand, Robert Goforth, received roughly 40% of the vote.
Goforth's campaign was less about policy and politics, and more about culture. He argued that Bevin, a New Hampshire native, wasn't one of us and didn't share Kentuckian values of basic politeness. As one Goforth supporter once told me, Bevin isn't the type of man you invite to grandma's house for potato salad.
Attorney General Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has tried to capitalize on that by repeatedly referring to Bevin as a bully, as erratic and as someone you can't take your kids to go see because of what he might say next.
Cillizza: There are lots (and lots) of comparisons made between Bevin and Trump. Are they fair/appropriate?
Bailey: In many ways Bevin was a preview of Trump's candidacy when he first ran in 2015. He was an outsider and businessman who shrugged off political norms, such as refusing to release his tax returns after initially saying he would.
But there are some clear differences between the two. 
The President is much more of a showman and entertainer who appears to enjoy the political fray and joust. Trump also inserts himself at the center of his political philosophy oftentimes.
Bevin is a true believer and a crusader who genuinely believes the country's future is on the line when it comes to his evangelical beliefs around abortion, for instance. The governor often speaks in larger Socratic lectures about how the country has lost its way in terms of its values, its media and its politics.
Cillizza: The national Democratic Party isn't popular in Kentucky. So how is Andy Beshear in the race?
Bailey: Andy Beshear is the son of a former governor, Steve Beshear, who left office as a popular rural Democrat [known] for expanding Medicaid. The Beshear family has been in Kentucky politics for about four decades and have name recognition from Paducah (Western Kentucky) to Pikeville (Eastern Kentucky) in the state.
Andy Beshear is also a methodical and disciplined candidate (some would say stiff) who has been hammering a message that as attorney general he's stopped controversial parts of Bevin's agenda to overhaul state pensions and cut higher education funding.
He also is working from a playbook by state Democrats that still believes off-year elections inoculate them from the national party, which is far more liberal than ancestral Democrats in the Bluegrass State. He has a two-punch combo on the campaign trail: anti-Bevin and kitchen table issues such as health care, education and jobs.
Cillizza: How much of this race has been about national issues (Trump/impeachment etc.) and how much is about state stuff?
Bailey: In the early stages it appeared this race was going to be all about health care, the economy and pension reform. But near the end of the summer the Bevin campaign made a clear pivot to talking almost exclusively about Trump, abortion and illegal immigration as much as the governor's accomplishments.
Cillizza: Finish this sentence: ""If Bevin wins, the person who deserves the most credit is ___________."" Now explain.
Bailey: ""Donald Trump.""
The President has a frenzied fan base in Kentucky, which is only fueled by the talk of impeachment. One Democratic legislator told me at a Beshear campaign event that the party has one specific rule while out on the campaign trail and that is to never talk about Trump.
Trump is just as much of a cultural beacon for white, rural, conservative voters in the state as a political figure. He captures that mojo and was able to lend it to Bevin, who made every mistake possible in terms of traditional state politics.

"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:32:08 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/politics/austin-homelessness/index.html,Tent cities emerged across Austin this summer after the city effectively made it legal for homeless residents to camp under highway overpasses.,"Austin, Texas (CNN)Tent cities emerged across Austin this summer after the city effectively made it legal for homeless residents to camp under highway overpasses. 
The move sparked a fierce debate across the city over the best way of dealing with what some residents describe as a homelessness crisis.
Steve Adler, Austin's mayor, says while it might seem that the homeless population has grown, the new city ordinance decriminalizing city camping has simply brought people experiencing homelessness out of the shadows.
""They're more visible and I know that's disconcerting to a lot of people. It's disconcerting to see poverty in this city,"" Adler said. ""We haven't created any more people experiencing homelessness.""
The mayor argues that by allowing homeless residents to camp on city streets, it's made their lives safer. He says fewer are sleeping hidden away in the city's wooded areas.
The city's approach has drawn the ire of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The Republican governor has unleashed months of social media attacks arguing the relaxed rules spurred lawlessness and indecency in the streets. Even some frustrated Democrats in this liberal city find themselves applauding the Republican governor after he used state resources on Monday to clean up the underpasses. 
The Texas Department of Transportation posted notices last week at 17 locations announcing it would soon clear out the encampments. Just days later, workers in bright orange vests were scooping up piles of trash and left-behind belongings. The sounds of shovels scraping the concrete competed with the deafening roar of cars driving overhead.
 
The controversial cleanups started Monday under a highway in the southwest part of the city. However, the cleanups only went so far. It's still legal for people to camp under the highways due to the city's revised ordinances, and many of the homeless are expected to return. 
William Rainey, 56, knew the cleanup was coming and he packed up all of his belongings into two shopping carts. He sat and watched the crews fill dumpsters of discarded items. Rainey says he welcomes the cleanup to remove trash but that the efforts aren't going to help homeless people like him.
Rainey ended up on the streets two years ago. He says his life unraveled after his wife died and he fell into a bad crowd. Now he describes himself as ""depressed, down and out."" He says after the city changed its camping ordinance he moved out of the woods and started sleeping under the bridge that was being cleaned out.
""I'm safe. I feel safe. I'm around people that I know, that camp with me,"" Rainey said. ""Some people don't like homeless people. They'd rather not see us out here.""
Chris Baker, the executive director of a homeless advocacy group called The Other Ones Foundation, loaded up a white truck with bicycles, bags, and tents amid the cleanups, sparing them from becoming trash. 
""This is theater, this is political theater,"" Baker said of the cleanups. ""This is just a shuffling around of people that will go on and on forever until we find places that people can be... safe and they can be stable.""
John Wittman, a spokesman for the governor's office, said Abbott would order the cleanups on a weekly basis -- or even more often, if need be -- while the state continues to work on what it says is a plan for a longer-term option.
 
In the meantime, homeless residents like Andrea Aguilar say they're going to keep returning to the underpasses as long as possible. 
""I'm not going to run and hide in the woods,"" said Aguilar, who packed up her things and kept them just off to the side of an underpass, waiting for the state to come do the cleanup on Monday. ""I'm going to go right back under the bridge. Right back under there."" 
'Austin is way too kind' 
In June, the city council made it easier for homeless people to sit, lie, and camp in more spaces across Austin, including many sidewalks. Previously, homeless residents were ticketed for such actions, leading to court dates and fines that people wouldn't attend or pay. That made it harder for them to get jobs and housing, said Chris Harris, a homeless advocate who works with a group called Homes Not Handcuffs.
The new rules also made it possible for the homeless to congregate in the downtown area and stay closer to resources and jobs, rather than in the woods, away from view. ""People that have come out of hiding now are getting medical attention that they weren't getting,"" said Adler. ""They are getting access to housing and services in ways that did not happen before.""
The outcome resulted in fierce pushback from some business owners and residents across the city. They formed groups opposing the new rules, and launched a petition against the ordinances. Some were seen Monday gathering signatures to recall the mayor. 
Mark Garcia, who leads the group Take Back Austin, said he's not protesting homelessness but what he called the vagrancy of those taking advantage of the new rules and being homeless by choice. ""The vagrants are clogging up the system and preventing actual homeless people from getting the resources that they need.""
Rainey, who's been residing under an overpass, expressed frustration with others who lived there and who wouldn't pick up their own trash. ""A lot of homeless people are taking advantage and they just don't care. If everybody cared, we... wouldn't have this problem at all. They wouldn't be coming out here to have to clean up."" 
Another man who said he was recently out of prison and now lived under an Austin overpass said he doesn't blame people who are upset about the new rules. ""I wouldn't want to see my city like this."" 
""Austin is way too kind,"" he continued. ""I'm from Houston. They would never let me do this."" 
Aguilar said the new rules are simply letting people live more comfortably while homeless. ""And why can't we be comfortable?""
'It's a bizarre world'
Austin resident Cleo Petricek formed a group called the SAFE Project that has tracked crime near homeless encampments and shelters since the new ordinances went into place. She actively lobbies the city council to come up with another solution to the homelessness problem. 
A diehard Democrat, Petricek feels frustrated that she's now supporting the actions of a Republican governor, but she's glad someone is using their ""bully pulpit to say 'Hey, Austin, this needs to stop right now.' We're at a crisis point.""
Kent Dahlgren, who described himself as a progressive Democrat, moved to Austin from Portland after the Oregon city's relaxed rules on homelessness affected his wife's business. He said people would sleep and defecate outside the door of the business  and harass customers. 
Though he feels the new rules in Austin are rooted in compassion, the end result is ""catastrophe,"" and he worries it will turn the political makeup of the city. ""I've never voted Republican, and I'm worried they're going to turn this town red.""
Dahlgren said he can't believe he lines up with politicians like Abbott or even President Donald Trump, who's been admonishing West Coast cities over how they're handling homelessness. ""It's bizarre,"" he said, expressing bewilderment that he agrees with Trump's rhetoric. ""It's a bizarre world.""
In the same vein, Abbott has also taken to Twitter to scold the state's capital and Democratic mayor, posting videos -- some of which have now been debunked -- of what he claims are homeless people causing disarray in Austin. He drew outrage after he retweeted video of a man attacking a car at a stoplight and implied the man was homeless. The man's family told CNN he was not homeless, but was mentally ill and was not taking his medication that day. 
Critics felt the governor was inflaming the homelessness issue in Austin by worsening stereotypes and stoking fear. Abbott did not respond to a CNN request to be interviewed for this story.
Last month, the governor threatened that if the city didn't drastically change its laws by November 1, the state would intervene. He took his first step on Monday with the cleanups under highways, but he also listed other measures the state could enact in Austin, such as bringing in the Health and Human Services Commission to address what he called public safety concerns or using the attorney general's office to seek ""civil penalties for violations of Texas statutes and rules requiring abatement of public health nuisances.""
Critics say Abbott is merely politicizing the issue and playing to his base, not creating any meaningful solutions. 
""I don't think he cares about homeless people. I think he cares about the homeless issue in so far as he... wants it to be eradicated,"" said Baker, the homeless advocate. ""If this is the solution that... they're going to try to bring, this is no solution at all.""

That response from the President begs the question: Where are these ""real"" polls? And what do they say? And why haven't we seen them. (OK, so I guess it begged three questions.)
A bit of digging turns up some breadcrumbs on the what-the-heck-is-Trump-talking-about trail.
On Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted this: 
""If the media's pollsters had been right in 2016, Hillary would be president. They're wrong on impeachment, too. Our data shows @realDonaldTrump has GAINED support in our target states since the beginning of October. Pelosi's charade is backfiring!"".
And then there was this from McDaniel late last week: 
""Our internal polling shows that despite the Democrats' bogus attacks on @realDonaldTrump, his approval rating has increased! And in our 17 target states, voters oppose the Democrats' efforts to remove President Trump by 14 points! Stop The Madness.""
Presumably, the ""real"" polls Trump is talking about are the same polls that McDaniel is referencing. And of course, the RNC -- and the Trump campaign -- are polling regularly to test not just the President's standing with the public but also the efficacy of a wide variety of potential campaign messages.
Which is fine! And smart!
(Sidebar: If McDaniel -- or any Republican -- thinks there are 17 swing states in 2020 then they are, well, wrong.)
But if Trump is going to insist that he has ""real"" polls that show that suggest impeachment is less popular among fewer people than a series of national media polls, then there is some burden of proof on him to at least show some of those polls, right? 
Think of it this way: If in junior high school, you told people that you had a girlfriend who lived in Montana, at some point, it would become clear that she likely didn't exist. Because no one had seen her or knew her. The burden of proof would be on you at that point to prove that she a) did exist and b) was an internationally recognized supermodel.
That's not to say Trump's ""real"" polls don't exist or even that they don't show that the House impeachment investigation is potentially politically perilous for Democrats. (I happen to think it is!) It is to say that Trump can't just keep citing secret polls that only he (and McDaniel, apparently) have seen that show him doing way better than all the public stuff that's out there.
And honestly, wouldn't Trump want to have some of that data out in the public? Right now, the dominant narrative is that he is on defense on Ukraine and that support for impeachment is rising. If the Trump campaign or the RNC has numbers that show that impeachment is hurting Trump a lot less in swing states than people think, it would seem to be in the campaign's best interest to release at least some of those numbers, right?
Why haven't they? I don't know. I think it is possible Trump has simply made up the polling -- or, more likely, greatly exaggerated how good it looks for him. Or the campaign is making some sort of strategic decision about what data it releases and when.
No matter the reason, the lack of actual data to back up the claims made by the President -- combined with his long history of not telling the truth -- make it very hard to take him at his word.

The teams in the two early nominating states were told they were being let go on Monday. Their last days at work will be next week, the aide said.
This comes after CNN first reported on Saturday that the Castro campaign was looking to downsize, supporting staffers looking for other jobs and pivoting their focus to Iowa, Nevada and Texas.
""In pushing to keep Secretary Castro's critical voice in this race, our campaign, like many others, will make adjustments in staffing and resources,"" Hackett said, in response to a story first reported by Politico. ""This race is shifting as we speak, and Julián will continue to be fearless and defy expectations by making the most of our resources.""
Some Castro aides outside of New Hampshire and South Carolina have taken the campaign up on that offer and other campaigns have received inquiries from would-be former Castro aides.
All of this is a bid to keep Castro's campaign solvent as the former Housing and Urban Development secretary works to qualify for the November debate, something he has yet to do.
Castro has struggled for months to raise money or get attention in the still large field of Democrats vying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. Castro spent the final 10 days of October pushing to raise $800,000 and pledged to donors that he would drop out if he failed to hit that goal. The campaign narrowly hit the goal with hours to go on October 31.
But the decision to lay off staff in the wake of that fundraising push raises questions about how long the money can actually propel the former San Antonio mayor.
Castro also plans to go on air with a small $50,000 ad in Iowa starting on Tuesday morning, a bid to drum up enough publicity and support to register at 3% in the needed statewide polls to make the November debate.

While polls generally show Trump retaining strong support overall among blue-collar whites, more detailed results in several recent surveys reveal a critical distinction: Trump faces much more resistance among working-class whites who are not evangelical Christians than among those who are. If Democrats can advance through that opening, it could prove crucial in 2020, because evangelicals compose a much smaller share of the white working-class population in the pivotal Rust Belt battleground states, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, than they do in the South.
The divergence over Trump between working-class whites who are and are not evangelicals ""is one of the most important political gaps we have,"" says Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization that studies the role of religion in politics.
The widening polarization of the electorate during Trump's tumultuous presidency is magnifying the potential impact of that gap in 2020. The working-class white voters who are not evangelical Christians, especially the women in that group, loom as a potentially decisive swing block between the evangelicals who have rallied around Trump and the non-evangelical college-educated whites who have recoiled from him. 
On a wide array of cultural and political questions, these non-evangelical blue-collar whites express views that place them between those two antithetical voting blocks. On balance, they lean toward culturally conservative positions, but not nearly as fervently as the evangelical Christians do. And while they express clear concerns about Trump's conduct during his presidency, they aren't nearly as alienated from him as the non-evangelical whites with advanced education. 
On every front, these voters look closely divided. ""They are cross-pressured,"" says Jones.
Voters with most conservative views
In the 2018 election, these three groups were roughly similar in size, according to results from the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of media organizations including CNN. White evangelicals at all education levels and college-educated whites who are not evangelicals each cast about 1 in 4 votes. The non-college whites who are not evangelicals represented a little more than one-fifth of voters, with racial minorities making up the remainder.
The Public Religion Research Institute's annual American Values Survey, released last month, provides a precise snapshot of these differences. At my request, for several central questions the institute examined the results among these key groups of white voters. First, they divided whites into those with and without four-year college degrees. Then they divided those groups into those who are and are not evangelical Christians. Finally, they split the groups a third time, by gender. (College-educated white evangelicals were too small a group to divide again by gender, so they reported the results for men and women combined; to keep the results comparable, they also reported the results for the college-educated non-evangelicals among both genders.)
The results showed that white evangelicals without college degrees consistently take a more conservative stance on social and economic issues than any other segment of voters. The men and women in that group differed little in their staunchly conservative perspective, particularly on issues that touch on racial anxieties. 
For instance, 75% of non-college white evangelical men and 65% of the women agreed that discrimination against whites is now as big a problem in America as discrimination against minorities; three-fourths of the men and two-thirds of the women also agreed with the harshly worded statement that ""Immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background."" Four-fifths of the men and two-thirds of the women agreed it is ""necessary to believe in God to be moral and have good values."" Three-fourths of the men and two-thirds of the women agreed that the ""Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists.""
Differences among white evangelicals
An even greater share of college-educated white evangelicals (four-fifths of them) said they believed socialists had taken over the Democratic Party. But on cultural issues, those white-collar evangelicals were considerably less militant than their working-class counterparts. Only a little more than half of the college evangelicals agreed that immigrants are ""invading"" the country or that whites face as much discrimination as blacks; a slight majority of them even rejected the idea that it was ""necessary"" to believe in God to be moral.
Jones says the contrast on these responses illuminates a larger point: that the college-educated evangelicals are somewhat less likely to feel a sense of ""siege"" in a changing America than their working-class counterparts do. ""They are less apocalyptic and less apoplectic than non-college evangelicals,"" he says. Still, the non-college white evangelicals set much more of the tone for the group overall because they represent about 70% of the evangelical population, studies by Public Religion Research Institute and other groups have found. 
The educational differences among evangelicals extend even to one key assessment of Trump: Just over half of the college-educated evangelicals, compared with only about one-fourth of those without degrees, said in the religion research institute's survey that they believe he has damaged the dignity of the presidency.
But that skepticism extends only so far: Even three-fourths of the college-educated white evangelicals in the institute's survey said they approve of Trump's performance in office, a result comparable to his support among those without degrees. And just 16% of those college evangelicals support Trump's impeachment and removal from office, compared with 7% of non-college evangelical men and 23% percent of the women. Across all educational levels, evangelical Christians ""are still a solid Trump constituency,"" says Jones. ""They really haven't walked away.""
Non-evangelical whites and Trump
At the other end of the spectrum among white voters, Trump faces huge skepticism among college-educated whites who are not evangelicals. These voters, often clustered in suburbs around major metropolitan areas, had been trending toward the Democratic Party since the early 1990s, as cultural issues such as abortion, gun control and gay rights increasingly have defined political debate. That movement has been turbocharged as Trump has polarized the electorate around issues of immigration and race.
On key cultural issues, these well-educated non-evangelical whites lean almost as sharply toward the left as evangelicals do toward the right. In the religion institute survey, two-thirds of the college-educated whites who are not evangelicals rejected the idea that whites face as much discrimination as minorities; more than three-fourths disagreed that immigrants are ""invading"" America. Nearly three-fourths of them said it's not necessary to believe in God to be moral. A 55% majority of them said racists have taken over the Republican Party, while 59% rejected the idea that socialists now rule the Democratic Party. 
On Trump, almost three-fourths of these non-evangelical college whites said he has damaged the dignity of the presidency. Two-thirds of them say they disapprove of his performance in office and more than three-fifths said they would support not only his impeachment but also his removal from office.
The working-class whites who are not evangelicals occupy a potentially pivotal space between these two opposing -- and roughly equal size -- groups of evangelicals and non-evangelical college-educated whites. The non-evangelical blue-collar whites display mixed instincts on racial and cultural issues. A slight majority of them agree that whites face as much discrimination as minorities, and an even narrower majority support building Trump's proposed border wall. But only a little more than two-fifths of them agree that immigrants are ""invading"" America, a perspective that draws vastly more agreement among non-college whites who are evangelicals.
Their views on Trump are similarly conflicted. More than half of the blue-collar non-evangelical whites say he has damaged the dignity of the presidency -- about twice the level of concern expressed by the non-college evangelicals. Support for impeaching and removing him from office reaches 43% among the men and 46% among the women. And they closely divide over his job performance: 55% of the men, but only 45% of the women, give him positive grades. On both of those measures, they are far more likely than the blue-collar white evangelicals to express negative views about Trump.
Two other new surveys offer further insights into what these patterns might mean for 2020. One is the new Nationscape project, a weekly survey of 6,000 Americans conducted by the Democracy Fund's Voter Study Group and two political scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles. At my request, the project combined results of its surveys from mid-July to late October to explore early preferences among these groups in a potential 2020 race between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.
That analysis showed Trump maintaining generally solid support among evangelical Christians. (He did, however, show some signs of potential slippage among evangelical women with college degrees compared with his showing among them in the exit polls for the 2016 election.) At the other end of the white education and religious spectrum, the Nationscape results showed Biden posting an advantage of more than 30 percentage points among college-educated white women who are not evangelicals and a nearly double-digit lead among the equivalent men. Each of those results was roughly the same as Hillary Clinton's performance in 2016, according to exit polls.
Compared with the 2016 exit polls, the Nationscape results showed Biden posting his biggest gains among the non-evangelical blue-collar men (trailing Trump among them by just 4 percentage points, compared with Clinton's much larger 23-point deficit in 2016) and the equivalent women: They preferred Biden by 10 percentage points in the Nationscape results, double Clinton's lead last time.
Warning signs in Wisconsin
Warning signs also emerged for Trump about his standing with non-evangelical whites without college degrees in recent polling in Wisconsin, the state that many believe could prove decisive in 2020. Those voters represent the state's largest single block: They make up just over 44% of Wisconsin's electorate, with the women slightly outnumbering the men, according to cumulative poll results from the Marquette University Law School poll provided by Charles Franklin, a pollster and professor of public policy there. (White evangelicals represent just under one-fifth of the state's voters and non-evangelical college-educated whites about one-fourth. Minorities compose the remaining roughly one-tenth of voters in Marquette's surveys.)
As in the national numbers, Trump retains very high approval ratings among white evangelicals in Wisconsin, though with some signs of erosion among those holding college degrees, according to cumulative results from the four most recent Marquette surveys that Franklin provided. In a hypothetical 2020 matchup against Biden, Trump still leads big with white evangelicals, especially the men without college degrees among them, according to combined results from surveys in August and October.
The mirror image is that in Wisconsin, as nationally, Trump faces resounding disapproval among the college-educated whites who are not evangelicals, particularly the women: More than two-thirds of them give him negative marks. Those women now prefer Biden over Trump for 2020 by nearly 3 to 1; Biden posts a solid double-digit advantage among the men as well.
But the working-class whites who are not evangelicals are more conflicted: 53% of the men say they approve of Trump's performance, while 59% of the women say they don't. In an October survey, the Marquette poll found that while two-thirds of these men oppose Trump's impeachment and removal, the women split almost exactly in half on whether he should be ousted. 
Matched against Biden, Trump leads among the non-evangelical blue-collar men by 10 percentage points, but trails by nearly 30 points among the women. (By contrast, Trump led in the survey by 40 points among the evangelical non-college white women.)
Most Democratic strategists agree that against Trump, the party has only limited opportunities for inroads among blue-collar white men, whether or not they are evangelical Christians. But they generally see a much greater opening among those white, non-college, non-evangelical women -- who some party strategists, slightly tongue in cheek, call WNCNEW. 
Even compared with the blue-collar non-evangelical men, those women generally express more concern about Trump's behavior and temperament and a greater sense of economic anxiety: In the Public Religion Research Institute survey nearly 3 in 5 of them said they would have trouble pulling together $400 to pay for an emergency, a higher share than any other group of whites. In the 2018 midterm elections, these women moved sharply toward Democratic candidates in House races, according to the exit poll results. 
Finding a nominee who can consolidate those gains -- especially in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the pivotal Rust Belt states that Trump captured in 2016 -- might be the shortest path back to the Oval Office for Democrats next year.

A common thread is emerging from the impeachment bombshells, court fights and multiple scandals all coming to head this week inside the one-year mark to the next general election. It's a picture of a President and his men who subscribe to a staggeringly broad interpretation of executive power and have no reservations about using it often for domestic political ends.
The trend, which threatens to recast the conception of the presidency shared by America's founders, shone through the first witness testimony released from the impeachment inquiry Monday.
One former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who apparently had been in the way of Trump's plans to get dirt from Ukraine on former Vice President Joe Biden, was shocked when the President told his counterpart in Kiev on a phone call that the official US diplomatic representative to his country was ""bad news.""
""I was very concerned, I still am,"" Yovanovitch said in her October 11 appearance before investigators, saying she felt ""threatened"" by the harassing words of her own President.
The comment came after she found that the President was running an off-the-books scheme to bypass US diplomats in the former Soviet state through his political fixer and personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
Another top State Department official, Michael McKinley, testified that he had resigned partly because of the use of the State Department to dig up dirt on Trump's political opponents.
""In 37 years in the Foreign Service and in different parts of the globe and working on many controversial issues, working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that,"" McKinley said, according to a transcript also released on Monday.
McKinley also said under oath that he had asked his boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for a statement of support for the beleaguered Yovanovitch.
Pompeo told ABC News last month that McKinley had never raised the issue. And the top US diplomat emerges from the testimony as more loyal to Trump's political goals than his own department's mission.
Democrats build abuse-of-power case 
The notion that Trump misused the power of his office to set foreign policy for personal political profit in Ukraine is at the center of the building Democratic impeachment case against him.
""With each new interview, we learn more about the President's attempt to manipulate the levers of power to his personal political benefit,"" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said on Monday.
The President's repeated demands for testimony from the whistleblower who blew open the scandal are beginning to sound like he is encouraging a leak that exposes the person's identity -- in itself a questionable use of the mighty powers of his office.
Republicans have embraced varied arguments when they are not faulting the integrity of the Democratic impeachment process. Some have argued that there is no quid pro quo -- despite evidence that appears to show Trump made military aid conditional on the opening of investigations on Biden and the 2016 election.
Others have argued that Trump has sweeping power to dictate foreign policy and so they deny accusations that he abused a public trust by wielding national power for personal ends. But it is not only in Ukraine where the concept of an unfettered presidency above the law has become a dominant theme of the most unconventional administration in modern history.
A US appeals court on Monday rejected Trump's claim that he was not obligated to turn over his tax returns to a grand jury because as President he was immune not only from prosecution but also from investigation.
The act of refusing to open his tax returns for voters is a sign in itself that Trump believes the obligations of power accepted by previous presidents do not apply to him.
His lawyers went further, however, arguing that since he enjoys special protection, his accountants could not comply with a subpoena to make his returns available to a grand jury.
But in writing the opinion for the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals, Chief Judge Robert Katzmann used Supreme Court precedent to reject Trump's claim.
Trump now plans to appeal to the Supreme Court in a landmark case that could set the parameters of presidential power for generations if he prevails and will be an early test of the new conservative majority he enshrined on the nation's top bench.
Concerns that the administration is using political power for nakedly political ends have also mushroomed in recent days over Attorney General William Barr's foreign travels in pursuit of his inquiry into the origins of the Russian election interference investigation. CNN reports suggest that allied intelligence services have been alarmed that Barr is seeking their assistance in incriminating officials in US spy agencies.
Trump has previously repeatedly sought to undermine the independence of the Justice Department and the reputation of former special counsel Robert Mueller.
A trend visible ever since Trump took office 
Although examples of Trump's apparent stretching of presidential authority have piled up in recent days, he's been at it since his first days in office.
After all, fired FBI chief James Comey testified to Congress that Trump demanded an oath of loyalty when they met for dinner in early 2017. Such a relationship of patronage would have infringed the invisible wall between the White House and the top organs of justice in the US government.
The Mueller report shows how Trump repeatedly demanded that his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, ignore his institutional responsibilities and withdraw his recusal from overseeing the Russia investigation -- an overtly political act.
The President's aggressive assertions of his power often seem to be an extension of a domineering character that served him well in the shark pond of New York real estate -- but also often had him brushing up against the law.
They often seem bred from a misconception of the powers of the presidency itself -- or a lack of the appreciation for constitutional principles that many of his predecessors shared.
For instance, Trump has argued -- inaccurately -- that a Constitution written in repudiation of monarchal or absolute power renders him effectively above the law.
""I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President,"" he said back in July.
Uncertain political implications
While the trend of Trump's power grabs is clear, their ultimate political implications are yet to be settled.
House Democrats seem likely to succeed in impeaching him, and will lay down a historical marker on the limits of presidential power. But if the Republican-led Senate declines to convict Trump of impeachable crimes, the President's past behavior suggests he will perceive a validation of his behavior.
While Trump's constant grating against constitutional limits is a big deal in Washington, it's less certain the rest of the nation is as preoccupied by his aberrations.
In fact, the Trump reelection campaign is using his unrestrained conduct as a selling point -- arguing in an ad that he's ""No Mr. Nice Guy"" but that his bullish persona is gutting the Washington establishment.
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden has made what he calls Trump's abuses the centerpiece of his campaign, but the party's other potential challengers seem as equally keen to debate health care as an imperial presidency. 
Some legal experts warn that the current moment is reverberating with national peril.
""We are seeing a misunderstanding amongst many people in the public that this is somehow abusing the President, this is an abuse of process, this is harassment, this is unfair,"" said former federal prosecutor Kim Wehle.
""All Americans have to understand that the office of the presidency has to have checks and balances. Someone else will hold that job,"" Wehle, author of the new book ""How to Read the Constitution -- and Why,"" told CNN's Brianna Keilar.
""If we allow that office to have no limitations, no boundaries, eventually, the framers understood this: It is human nature to abuse power and to ultimately use it against regular people.""

With White House officials refusing to testify behind closed doors, the Democrats running the impeachment inquiry began releasing transcripts of previous closed-door testimony, which has taken the better part of a month. 
First up, they released the depositions of Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was besmirched and who raised concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow foreign policy. They also released testimony from Michael McKinley, a former ambassador and top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who quit his job in protest when Pompeo and others would not stand up for Yovanovitch.  
Read a full wrap-up of their testimony or check out the highlights below.
1. Yovanovitch said she was warned to 'watch my back'
The former ambassador told impeachment investigators that a Ukrainian official warned her in 2019 to ""watch my back"" because of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. 
""He basically said, and went into some detail, that there were two individuals from Florida, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were working with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had set up the meetings for Mr. Giuliani with Mr. Lutsenko. And that they were interested in having a different ambassador at post, I guess for because they wanted to have business dealings in Ukraine, or additional business dealings."" 
Giuliani helped push Trump to call for Ukraine to investigate Burisma and Hunter Biden. Parnas and Fruman have been charged with unrelated campaign finance violations.
2. Yovanovitch felt threatened by Trump's words
When Yovanovitch read the transcript of the call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, she was confused and worried.
Trump had told Zelenksy of Yovanovitch, ""she's going to go through some things.""
During the testimony in October, Yovanovitch was asked what that could mean.
""I don't know what it meant,"" she said. ""I was very concerned. I still am.""
""Did you feel threatened?"" she was asked.
""Yes,"" she responded.
3. The ambassador needed protection from a presidential tweet
Yovanovitch also described being told she'd have to leave her post and that she needed to get out of the country -- not for her physical security, but to keep her safe from a Trump tweet.
Describing a conversation she had with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who has since been nominated as US ambassador to Russia, Yovanovitch said he specifically mentioned Twitter.
""This was coming from President Trump, this was, you know, final, and that I -- that the reason they pulled me back is that they were worried that if I wasn't, you know, physically out of Ukraine, that there would be, you know, some sort of public either tweet or something else from the White House. And so this was to make sure that I would be treated with as much respect as possible.""
4. She angered Giuliani with a blocked visa
Yovanovitch described at length the ties between Giuliani and Victor Shokin, the prosecutor Joe Biden and others opposed in Ukraine for not combating corruption. And she said she helped block a visa for Shokin to visit the US, a trip she later learned was in part so that he could meet with Giuliani to reveal dirt on Democrats. She said Shokin lied on his visa application.
5. She asked for support and didn't get it
The former ambassador said she asked for support when she was attacked by Giuliani and others. But she didn't get it and one reason is there was a fear that Trump could undercut the State Department.
""What I was told is that there was concern that the rug would be pulled out from underneath the State Department if they put out something publicly. You know, that perhaps there would be a tweet of disagreement or something else.""
6. Sondland told Yovanovitch to protect herself by tweeting a pro-Trump message
When she felt criticized by Trump allies and the State Department failed to defend her, Yovanovitch testified that she called US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland for his advice. His advice was to tweet fealty to Trump.
""(Sondland) said, you know, you need to go big or go home. You need to, you know, tweet out there that you support the President, and that all these are lies and everything else."" 
He later added: ""You know the President. Well, maybe you don't know him personally, but you know, you know, the sorts of things that he likes. You know, go out there battling aggressively and, you know, praise him or support him."" 
Yovanovitch didn't want to tweet about Trump since she's a career foreign service officer. Sondland is not a career diplomat and Trump donor, so it seemed natural to him.
7. Trump may have called into Giuliani meeting with Ukraine prosecutor
Trump's personal pressure campaign on Ukraine has been thought to focus on the new President there, Volodymyr Zelensky. But Yovanovitch testified officials in Ukraine thought he was also on the phone for a meeting between Rudy Giuliani and then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko.
This is far from first-hand information. She said that Lutsenko's deputy told her deputy, who told her. 
""So you're saying was that Mr. Lutsenko had told him that the President had phoned into their meeting?"" she was asked.
 ""Uh-huh,"" she replied.
 ""Is that a yes?"" she was asked.
 ""That's a yes,"" she said. 
8. Sean Hannity may know more than Mike Pompeo
If you were to compare the influence of the Fox News host and Trump confidant to the US secretary of state, it's not at all clear who would win.
Yovanovitch testified that when she was told she was being recalled, she was told that someone (Pompeo?) would call up Hannity to figure out what was going on.
""What I was told by (Senior State Department official) Phil Reeker was that the Secretary or perhaps somebody around him was going to place a call to Mr. Hannity on Fox News to say, you know, what is going on? I mean, do you have proof of these kinds of allegations or not? And if you have proof, you know, telI me, and if not, stop.""
At the time, Yovanovitch was the subject of attacks by Hannity, Giuliani and Donald Trump, Jr., the President's son.
9. Pompeo adviser quit over politics being forced on diplomats
""The timing of my resignation was the result of two overriding concerns: the failure in my view, of the State Department to offer support to Foreign Service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry; and, second, by what appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to advance domestic political objectives,"" McKinley said.
He also said he raised the issue of the State Department issuing a statement of support for Yovanovitch before she was recalled, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo never acted on it. 
Pompeo told ABC News in October that McKinley never raised in concerns, but perhaps the time frame is different since Pompeo is careful to say he heard no complaints after Yovanovitch left Ukraine.
""From the time that Ambassador Yovanovitch departed Ukraine until the time that he came to tell me that he was departing, I never heard him say a single thing about his concerns with respect to the decision that was made,"" Pompeo said.
McKinley said he offered his resignation September 30 and stayed on a short time after that, so this period of time is less than a week after the transcript of the call in which Trump disparaged Yovanovitch was released.
10. McKinley forwarded allegations of bullying
McKinley described his conversations with George Kent, the State Department official overseeing Eurasian policy, and he was told by Kent that the department was not being supportive of people swept into the inquiry. McKinley used the term ""bullying tactics"" and forwarded a memo Kent wrote.
11. Republicans are taking part in the inquiry
The White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill have attacked the process of the impeachment inquiry for being closed and for not featuring White House lawyers. Democrats have countered that open hearings will come and that Trump will have the opportunity to defend himself. The transcripts clearly show that Republicans are taking part in the testimony. Republican lawmakers and attorneys ask tough questions of the witnesses.

"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 15:14:12 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/politics/justice-department-memo-ukraine-testimony/index.html,"The Justice Department said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are ""legally invalid"" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.","Washington (CNN)The Justice Department said attempts by impeachment investigators to compel testimony from executive branch witnesses about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine are ""legally invalid"" unless they allow for the witnesses to bring a government lawyer.
The guidance, from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, amounts to a new legal reasoning that the White House and other agencies can use to stymie House depositions after Democrats curtailed the previous legal argument that the House wasn't in a formal impeachment inquiry with a vote last week. The memo is certain to anger Democrats as it furthers a strategy of non-cooperation from the White House in the inquiry, and once again puts the Justice Department in the position of blocking the President from further scrutiny.
Impeachment investigators had so far benefited from several depositions from current and former national security officials about the Ukraine saga, but in recent days, a number of current and former government witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, have all skipped out on scheduled depositions.
In the memo, OLC lawyers write that the President, who has not been asked or subpoenaed to testify, must be allowed to have a representative present in depositions to be able to protect privileged information from disclosure. The House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has so far only allowed witnesses to appear for depositions with personal counsel.
The five-page memo appears limited in scope but potentially sets up a future fight over the impeachment investigators' ability to pierce the administration's shield of executive privilege, which could block witnesses from providing valuable information about Trump's direct involvement in the case.
OLC attorneys cite a DC Circuit court opinion comparing an impeachment inquiry with a grand jury investigation in a criminal probe, setting up the need to meet a high threshold to overcome the protections of the privilege.
The administration's new legal memo is untested in court. Witnesses are not permitted to bring lawyers into criminal grand juries, and federal courts have generally not allowed administration blocking attempts to stand in the way of criminal investigators or of Congress' needs during impeachment proceedings. As recently as last month, a federal judge told the administration it couldn't block the House's pursuit of confidential grand jury information sought for the impeachment proceedings, for example.
The memo was released Monday and written on November 1, the day after the House approved the rules of an impeachment inquiry in a full floor vote.

"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 15:26:35 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/politics/rand-paul-donald-trump-whistleblower-identity/index.html,"Republican Sen. Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.","Washington  (CNN)Republican Sen. Rand Paul, before a raucous crowd on Monday, demanded members of the media print the identity of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
""I say to tonight to the media: do your job and print his name,"" Paul, a Kentucky Republican, yelled during a rally Trump held in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin ahead of Tuesday's gubernatorial election. The crowd of Trump supporters, many donning ""READ THE TRANSCRIPT"" shirts, erupted into applause and cheers, and some chanted ""Do your job!"" and pointed toward the area where members of the press gathered to cover the event.
Paul told the crowd ""we also now know the name of the whistleblower,"" but did not provide any personal knowledge of the person's identity, before going on to echo baseless claims of wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. ""The whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,"" Paul said. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.
Several other Republicans have called for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed -- despite federal laws to protect individuals who file complaints -- but the sitting senator's insistence before a chanting crowd stands as one of the most forceful public calls yet. His comments drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who argue the person's identity has no bearing on the allegations lodged against the President.
During the rally on Monday, Paul called on Republican lawmakers to ""step up"" and subpoena the whistleblower, though a number of the witnesses called before House committees have corroborated what was written in the complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The anonymous whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump pressured Zelensky to help his reelection by investigating Biden, as well as a White House cover-up designed to keep information about the effort, led in part by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, out of public view.
On Sunday, Mark Zaid, an attorney for the whistleblower, said in a series of tweets that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have sought to ""expose our client's identity which could jeopardize their safety, as well as that of their family.""  
Zaid, who had been working with Congress to prevent his client's identity from being revealed if they were to be interviewed by lawmakers, on Sunday offered to have Republican lawmakers submit questions to his client directly without having to go through the committee's Democratic majority.
In September, the President said in a tweet, ""Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser,"" and he has since continued his calls for the whistleblower to be outed as House Democrats ratchet up their impeachment inquiry and tensions over the whistleblower's identity have deepened.
Two sources previously described to CNN a pattern of GOP questioning -- over the course of several congressional depositions related to the probe -- that appeared designed to try to identify the whistleblower through the course of asking witnesses, and putting into the deposition record, the names of various government officials involved that may fit the professional description that has been made public of the individual. Democrats and Republicans got into a shouting match over the matter last week during a closed door interview with a witness.
'Deeply troubling and disappointing' 
Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday criticized Paul, telling CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" that the senator's calls are a distraction from the impeachment inquiry spurred by the whistleblower's complaint.
""I went back and read the complaint last night. Virtually everything in that complaint has now been verified in public and public testimony, particularly the transcript of the -- the partial transcript ... of the call confirms exactly what the whistleblower said. So who it is -- I don't care if it's (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady, it doesn't matter because the investigation is 'what happened?' This is a distraction,"" King said. 
""It's deeply troubling and really disappointing,"" he said. 
Later on the same program, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on two of the House panels involved in the impeachment inquiry, said it's ""very dangerous stuff to be scapegoating and targeting the whistleblower.""
Raskin argued that the ""attempt to demonize and vilify the whistleblower is a scapegoating tactic"" that is a ""distraction from the merits of the case.""

"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 04:59:02 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/senate-preparations-for-impeachment-trial/index.html,"While senators await the House of Representatives to move into the public phase of their impeachment inquiry, aides and members are beginning to prepare for a likely Senate trial."," (CNN)While senators await the House of Representatives to move into the public phase of their impeachment inquiry, aides and members are beginning to prepare for a likely Senate trial.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are cautious: there are no articles of impeachment and the House hasn't voted to impeach the President. But, the logistical undertaking of a Senate impeachment trial isn't an easy lift and can't snap into action overnight leading to conversations that have begun in even small ways. 
Talks are underway between Senate aides and even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' team over simple things like where Roberts' office will be during the trial, one Senate aide told CNN. The last time the Senate did this was the 1990s for the trial of then-President Bill Clinton, when staffers didn't all need their own computers and the chief justice was housed just off the Senate floor in the Senate president's room. 
That room, logistically speaking 20 years later, isn't likely to work in an era where staffers need hardwired internet. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has been preparing members for the reality of what is to come: six-day work weeks, no talking on the Senate floor and the reality that not much Senate business -- if any -- will get done.
And, behind the scenes, some members and aides have been brushing up on the Federalist Papers and re-watching the Clinton impeachment, trying to gear up for what is an incredibly complicated and unusual process.
""I have read through the Federalist Papers and (I'm) looking at precedent with regards to other impeachments in the past and will continue that legal analysis. But, the fact analysis, we will have to wait for the House,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, told CNN last week.
Senate Democrats are also getting ready, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, contacting 2020 presidential candidates who may be glued to the Senate chamber well into December and January -- times when they'd typically be campaigning in Iowa. Multiple aides told CNN that Schumer has been having conversations with 2020 contenders about the next phase.
Schumer's office has also set up a central document hub of information where staffers can go to access information on what the House's impeachment inquiry looks like, Senate history and past impeachment battles.
Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, are in regular contact, per a senior Democratic aide. Schumer has asked his caucus to focus on a multi-faceted messaging strategy including that the House investigation must continue ""unimpeded;"" that senators have a responsibility to put country over party if a trial does take place; and the Senate ""can and should"" be talking about changing laws on gun safety, climate change, health care and election security even as the impeachment inquiry heats up, the aide said.
Schumer has held multiple conference calls with his caucus about impeachment, and the caucus has discussed this at Senate lunches.
A key question is whether lawmakers can come together to adopt a resolution on the rules of the trial, given the partisan nature of this impeachment inquiry.
During the Clinton impeachment, senators unanimously adopted a resolution that set the rules for that trial. Those rules set the witness list and schedule for things like when motions were due. Negotiations on such a resolution are not underway now, according to multiple aides CNN has talked to in the last several days, because members aren't sure the way the articles of impeachment will be drafted.
There is some institutional knowledge for this inquiry, in that 28 members currently in Congress were in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment, according to an aide. That list includes Sens. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Schumer, who were in the House for the impeachment in 1998 but then won election to the Senate in that year's midterm elections. Both were in the Senate for Clinton's trial in January and February of 1999. Frequent Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a congressman from South Carolina, was also one of the House managers during the Clinton impeachment.

"Mon, 04 Nov 2019 23:43:33 GMT",https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/how-cnn-got-robert-mueller-interviews/index.html,The release of the Mueller report was just the beginning. The headlines about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation this weekend came after months of legal pressure from CNN and others pressing the Justice Department to make more of his work public.," (CNN)The release of the Mueller report was just the beginning. The headlines about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation this weekend came after months of legal pressure from CNN and others pressing the Justice Department to make more of his work public.
On Saturday, both CNN and BuzzFeed published 274 pages of investigative notes and memos from Mueller's interviews with key witnesses about Russian interference in the 2016 election -- and the Trump campaign's involvement. The documents revealed that President Donald Trump, his family members and his top advisers pushed repeatedly to get access to hacked documents WikiLeaks was releasing throughout 2016. 
In one memo, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates remembered Trump saying, ""Get the emails."" Also of note, Mueller had learned that former campaign chairman Paul Manafort had pointed to Ukraine for hacking the Democratic emails, a conspiracy theory that lodged in Trump's mind and became part of what he asked the Ukrainian President for help with in July. 
The documents illustrated with new examples the factual conclusions Mueller found about how Trump has welcomed foreign help in elections. And they're only the first slim window into the massive trail of Trump campaign activity Mueller's team followed over two years. Mueller's team ultimately interviewed about 500 witnesses and gathered millions of documents, which he distilled into a dense collection of findings in his final report.
This is how we got the new documents.
The race for public access was on when Mueller finished his work in March.
CNN almost immediately began pinging the Justice Department and other agencies with requests for public access to more documents, citing the federal Freedom of Information Act. In all, I sent the Justice Department, FBI and other agencies almost 60 letters requesting different types of communications, memos and investigative paperwork related to the Mueller investigation, with most of my requests emailed out a day or two after Mueller said he was done. 
Through April and May, the federal agencies deflected nearly all of my requests related to Mueller, often saying they needed more time to review the requested documents because it was ""unusual circumstances"" and would need an unspecified amount of extra time to handle.
Under the Freedom of Information Act, the public has a right to access many records created by the federal government, from emails to calendar entries to other notes, within about a month following a request. But requests for sensitive information or lots of papers can take the government years to fulfill. Transparency groups like Judicial Watch and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sue frequently when they don't receive documents quickly, allowing them to jump to the front of the line for access. These groups, when they win, often make the documents public immediately on their websites, and the FBI and other agencies sometimes follow by posting the records on their websites as well.
News organizations including CNN, The Washington Post and others have worked together and succeeded in getting public access to sealed court records from the Mueller investigation. But most groups waited for Mueller to say he was finished before pushing FOIA issues into court.
Jason Leopold at BuzzFeed News, a reporter who's become known for his aggressive records requests and lawsuits fighting for the release of documents, also filed many Freedom of Information Act requests about Mueller. So had the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a transparency group that was first out of the gate to sue for access to Mueller's records. 
It sued under FOIA for the Mueller report and other documents Mueller created the day he announced his investigation was over. BuzzFeed News stepped up with its own set of lawsuits in early June, lumping dozens of Leopold's requests into each suit. One of BuzzFeed's lawsuits asked for a plethora of records that fell into six different categories, one being ""all FBI 302s,"" meaning memos from witness interviews, ""maintained/stored/in possession of the FBI"" related to the Mueller investigation.
CNN sued on June 4 for access to documents I had requested more than a month earlier: the ""FBI memoranda, such as 302s, from any and all of the interviews"" of the 500-some witnesses in the Mueller investigation, plus ""any and all case files related to"" those witnesses. Our lawyers, editors and I had realized we wanted to prioritize what we asked for when we went to court. We had zeroed in on the FBI 302s as our highest priority -- the limited, main set of documents we wanted the federal court's help to make public, and quickly.
Because both CNN and BuzzFeed had specifically asked for the FBI witness memos from the Mueller investigation, CNN's focused lawsuit was eventually combined with BuzzFeed's broader one.
Judge Reggie Walton of the federal court in Washington agreed with our news organizations' legal teams. At a hearing in early October, Walton ruled that the Justice Department should turn over the 302s in monthly chunks to CNN and BuzzFeed. 
""Obviously there is a real concern as to whether there is full transparency,"" Walton had said, shortly after the Electronic Privacy Information Center and BuzzFeed had taken their requests to court this summer.  He reiterated his concern about how slow a track the administration was on in making Mueller's documents transparent. ""The American public is going to become totally disillusioned,"" he said at the October hearing, after the Justice Department explained it didn't have the resources to process the recent avalanche of public records requests.
Walton gave the Justice Department its first deadline for November 1. The judge added that the administration must process 500 pages a month of the witness memos, and give CNN and BuzzFeed the public documents on the first of every month. 
So the Justice Department overnighted Leopold and me CDs on Friday. My request's FedEx tracking number gave a November 2 delivery -- a day late, and a weekend when Washington was largely distracted by its World Series parade.
Saturday morning, I drove to our lawyers' office in downtown DC, where a mail room employee had been specially waiting for the package's arrival. The handoff was complete. 
When I got the disc back to CNN's Washington bureau and popped it in a computer, one file held 274 pages containing redacted FBI memos. The memos described some of Mueller's interviews with Gates, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Among the documents, the Justice Department also provided the additional handwritten notes and relevant emails. The rest of the 500 pages due to us were withheld for reasons the Freedom of Information Act allows, the Justice Department said.
In less than a month, we're expecting the next CD.
The House of Representatives, in its impeachment investigation, is pursuing some of the same witness records under different law from FOIA. So far, the House has seen witness interview memos for 17 Mueller witnesses, including White House staffers Sean Spicer, Stephen Miller, Sarah Sanders and others. The Justice Department has said in court that it's working on getting another 16 witnesses' memos, including Bannon's and Gates', to the House. 
Conceivably, the memos CNN and BuzzFeed receive in the future could shed more light on what other key witnesses, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former White House counsel Don McGahn, said during their interviews. A few are already publicly available, like the memo the FBI wrote after interviewing Flynn in January 2017, when he lied.
Of those other 57 Freedom of Information Act requests I made related to the Mueller investigation, only one has come through. It turned up three pages of unnoteworthy emails about Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman's recusal from his office's investigation into Cohen, which was previously known.
The Justice Department has said it could take years to get us all 44,000 pages of the FBI memos that the judge has ordered it to make public -- and that's only a sliver of the millions of documents from the Mueller investigation.

They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday.,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's defenses of his actions often change over time. They rarely change quite as head-spinningly fast as they did on Sunday. 
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump continued to argue that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was ""perfect."" He claimed that the ""many people"" who listened to the call did not have a problem with it.
Then he made a flurry of very different arguments -- over the course of 74 total words. His claims in the second half of the paragraph contradicted his claims in the first.
Breaking down Trump's comments
Here is the paragraph as it appears in the official White House transcript: 
""And all of those many people that listened to the phone call, why didn't they have a problem with it? Because they didn't have -- many people listen to calls between -- I know that. For instance, the Secretary of State, Pompeo, was on the call. Nobody had -- with all of those people, very few people, that I know, came forward. And they only came forward when you asked. And some of them are Never Trumpers.""
Got that?
Let's break it down claim by claim.
1) The many people who listened to the call didn't have a problem with it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't have a problem. Nobody.
2) Very few people Trump knows came forward to raise concerns about the call.
3) The people who raised concerns about the call only did so after they were asked.
4) Some of the people who raised concerns about the call are ""Never Trumpers.""
In summary: Trump went from
A) claiming universal support for his actions from those who were on the call to
B) acknowledging people complained about his actions to
C) suggesting those people were prodded into complaining to 
D) alleging that those people harbor animosity toward him.
He can be a challenge to paraphrase. So let's dig in:
A fact check
As Trump had implicitly conceded by the end of the paragraph, there is no basis for his claim that ""nobody"" who listened to the call had a problem with it.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty Army officer and the top Ukraine expert at the White House's National Security Council, testified to Congress: ""I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine."" 
The Washington Post reported that ""at least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after"" the call; ""concerns soared in the call's aftermath,"" the Post reported officials said, and ""within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart.""
The whistleblower who filed a formal complaint about the call said that the White House officials who gave him (highly accurate) information ""were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call."" 
The White House has acknowledged that it stored a transcript of the call in a highly classified system. A senior official said in a September statement to CNN that this decision came at the direction of National Security Council attorneys.  
Trump has not elaborated on his claim that Vindman is a ""Never Trumper"" -- a term that has generally been used to describe longtime Republicans who steadfastly refuse to support Trump but that Trump himself appears to be deploying as a broader label for anyone who criticizes him. Asked what evidence he has to call Vindman a ""Never Trumper,"" Trump said Sunday, ""We'll be showing that to you real soon. OK?""
It was not clear who Trump was calling ""you"" when he told reporters that people who criticized the call ""only came forward when you asked."" Vindman said he was testifying ""voluntarily"" after receiving a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee; the media did not appear to have anything to do with it.
