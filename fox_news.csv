Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert slammed ""political correctness"" Tuesday in a statement commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Fort Hood shooting, alluding to a report that faulted political correctness as a reason why the FBI had not investigated warning signs about the Islamic radicalization of Maj. Nidal Hasan more thoroughly before he killed 13 people in a shooting rampage on the military base.
The report found the FBI had failed to interview Hassan when it found out about his contacts with terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki, waited too long to pursue leads and completed an assessment that was, ""belated, incomplete and rushed, primarily because of their workload.""
It also detailed the decision to not interview Hasan after a San Diego official recommended the FBI do so in June 2009: ""This is not (San Diego), it's D.C. and (the Washington office) doesn't go out and interview every Muslim guy who visits extremist websites,"" a paraphrase in the report says.
""Even political correctness should not have prevented people from noticing he had been radicalized and was a threat,"" Gohmert said Tuesday. ""Thankfully, we now have a president and an administration who understand radical Islamic jihadists are a danger to our way of life.""

Hasan, who killed 13 people in a 2009 shooting spree at a Texas Army base, has a court hearing in his case Thursday, Jan. 29, 2015 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he is being held on the military death row.

Hasan was sentenced to death by a military jury in 2013.

Tucson voters on Tuesday will decide whether to make the liberal enclave Arizona's only sanctuary city in a rebuke to President Trump’s immigration policies and a tough state anti-illegal immigration law that drew international condemnation nearly a decade ago. 
The measure, Proposition 205, would put new restrictions on when police can inquire about immigration status or cooperate with federal law enforcement.

      Tucson voters will decide Tuesday whether to declare itself a sanctuary city. 
      (tucsonaz.gov)
Tucson progressives say the measure will send a clear message to the Trump administration and give a voice to the city's sizable Latino community. 
The measure explicitly aims to neuter SB1070, a 2010 Arizona immigration law that drew mass protests and a boycott of Arizona. SB1070 prohibits sanctuary cities in Arizona and requires police to verify the immigration status of anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant. Courts threw out much of the law but upheld the requirement for officers to check immigration papers.

Tucson's mayor and city council members – all Democrats – oppose Proposition 205 because they're concerned the city could lose millions of federal and state funds, which make up a chunk of the Tucson's budget. They say police have already adopted rules that go as far as legally possible to restrict officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.

A handful of Republican state lawmakers have said they will pursue legislation to punish Tucson. Prior legislation approved by the GOP Legislature to tie the hands of liberal cities allows the state to cut off funding for cities that pass laws conflicting with state laws.

The result of the showdown in Kentucky -- as well as Tuesday's gubernatorial race in Mississippi and state legislature races in Virginia -- could serve as a barometer this week on whether Trump still has the ability to rally Republicans at the voting booth amid Democrats' ongoing impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats have acknowledged that Trump's influence helped the GOP sweep key House special elections in North Carolina in September. Amid chants of ‘USA’ at Monday's rally, Trump repeatedly sought to leverage his accomplishments in office, including energy independence and historically low unemployment rates, to boost Gov. Matt Bevin.”Trump: Bevin ‘a pain in the ass,’ but worth a second term - Lexington Herald Leader: “President Donald Trump gave Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin a Trumpian endorsement Monday night, just hours before Kentuckians go to the polls to decide if they’ll elect the Republican governor to a second term. ‘He’s such a pain in the ass,’ Trump said of Bevin. ‘But isn’t that what you want?’ It was a backhanded compliment meant to highlight how hard Bevin works for Kentucky, but it also called attention to the governor’s biggest political weakness: his penchant for making controversial remarks that alienate friends and foes alike. … The event, though, has huge importance for Bevin, who is locked in a tight race with Democrat Andy Beshear, the attorney general. Bevin has tied himself tightly to the president as he attempts to win back support after waging a public battle with teachers over their pension system.”Unusually close race in Mississippi - AP: “Mississippi’s most competitive governor’s race in years was in the hands of voters Tuesday as Attorney General Jim Hood sought to become the second Democratic governor in the Deep South. He’s facing Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who got campaign help in Mississippi from both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Hood, Reeves and two lesser-known candidates are on Tuesday’s ballot. The winner will succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. Democrats see Hood as their strongest nominee in nearly a generation in a conservative state where Republicans have been governor for 24 of the past 28 years.”Republican majorities on the line in Old Dominion - WTOP: “Virginians are going to the polls Tuesday to cast votes in local elections as well as General Assembly races that could change the composition of both chambers of the state’s legislature, while several D.C.-area towns in Maryland hold elections for mayor and council. In Virginia, the Republicans control both houses by the narrowest of margins. They hold a 21-19 advantage in the Senate and a 51-49 margin in the House of Delegates — that last only after a random drawing decided a tied election in District 94. These General Assembly elections will be the only ones conducted using the district maps chosen by a panel of federal judges in January, after ruling last year that lawmakers had racially gerrymandered 11 House districts by packing black voters into them.”THE RULEBOOK: BETTER NOT 
“Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 23TIME OUT: ‘TOO MODERN FOR ITS TIME’Atlantic: “Karolina Pavlova, born in 1807, wasn’t a woman who acted in accordance with social norms. The leader of a respected Moscow literary salon, she was also devoutly committed to her own writing. That trait was greeted with animosity from many of her male contemporaries, who disparaged her readiness to share her work as unwomanly and approached her soaringly emotive poetry with suspicion. Even so, Pavlova’s novel A Double Life shook the Russian literary world when it was published in 1848, earning widespread praise for its revolutionary form and psychological acuity. Pavlova had written a book depicting a woman’s struggle against social constraints, and—a full half century before Freud popularized the idea of the subconscious—insisting on the independence of the unconscious mind. …Barbara Heldt [translated] and released [a new edition] this year… Pavlova constructed a strikingly prescient psychological vision: a mind responding to extreme social pressure by slowly and completely separating itself into parts, but giving few external indications of change.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD

But among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of Trump, he receives no more than 7 percent support. Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent). South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the other two Democrats tested against Trump, also lead the president among registered voters, with Buttigieg up by 52 percent to 41 percent, and Harris ahead by 51 percent to 42 percent.”Castro gives up on New Hampshire and South Carolina - Politico: “Julián Castro’s campaign will fire its staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, an official familiar with the campaign told POLITICO. The campaign notified the state teams on Monday and their final day will be next week. The source said the campaign will continue focusing on Iowa and Nevada with a $50,000 television ad buy in Iowa beginning Tuesday morning. The moves amount to a long-shot attempt to remain in the presidential contest in the hopes of catching fire before the first contests begin next February. Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Barack Obama, has had success in framing — and, in some cases, starting — the Democratic primary’s policy debates but has struggled to raise money or raise his poll numbers above low single digits. Asked for comment, the Castro campaign pointed POLITICO to its statement last week when news of an Iowa-Nevada focus first surfaced.”Buttigieg adjusts campaign to utilize the moment - WaPo: “What is going on is Buttigieg seizing an opening in the Democratic presidential field, pushing his way into the gap between liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the more moderate former vice president Joe Biden. ‘The way we think this shapes up is, if you want the most ideological, far-out candidate possible, you’ve got your answer. You want the most Washington candidate possible, you’ve got your answer,’ Buttigieg said Saturday from his campaign bus in Iowa. … That positioning represents a significant shift from Buttigieg’s posture when he entered the race. Buttigieg made early headlines by portraying himself as the vanguard of generational change, a 37-year-old seeking to become the first openly gay president and talking up big liberal ideas, like abolishing the electoral college and restructuring the Supreme Court. While his campaign says he still supports those policies, he rarely mentions them on the campaign trail these days.”Harris’ long, hard fall - Politico: “Interviews with more than 50 people inside and around [Kamala Harris’] campaign … reveal how a candidate with so much promise, range and charisma has slid so far. Many of her dilemmas are self-creations. Harris undermined her national introduction with costly flubs on health care, feeding a critique that she lacks a strong ideological core and plays to opinion polls and the desires of rich donors. She was vague or noncommittal on question after question from voters at campaign stops. She leaned on verbal crutches instead of hammering her main points in high-profile TV moments. The deliberate, evidence-intensive way she arrives at decisions—one of her potential strengths in a matchup with Trump—often made her look wobbly and unprepared. … Her prospects look grim. Once-optimistic forecasts from her aides now diverge into complaints about biased treatment from the news media, some of them valid. But Harris has also struggled to figure out how to embrace her own record.”Swingers, 2020 edition - NYT: “They are similar in holding ideologically inconsistent views, but they otherwise span all walks of life, based on an analysis of 569 respondents to recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys in the six closest states carried by the president in the 2016 presidential election. These voters represent 15 percent of the electorate in the battleground states, and they say there’s a chance they’ll vote for either Mr. Trump or the Democrat. … The poll adds a new mix of characters to the quadrennial cast of swing voters, like a somewhat conservative, college-educated suburban man who does not approve of the president’s performance, but strongly opposes a single-payer health system. … For now, these persuadable voters in battleground states have a favorable view of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but not of Elizabeth Warren, our polling shows.”Team Obama makes show of support for cash-strapped Biden - Politico: “More than 30 high-ranking Obama administration officials are hosting a Wednesday soiree for Joe Biden intended to be equal parts fundraiser and public show of support for the former vice president’s 2020 campaign. The event is taking place at the home of ex-National Economic Council director Jeff Zients and his wife, Mary, as Biden hustles to raise money before primary voting begins. Biden's fundraising flagged during the most recent quarter, but Zients and others are also trying to send a message beyond the money chase, according to people familiar with the event planning. They want to show that while some Obama allies may have drifted toward candidates newer to the national political scene, including Pete Buttigieg, Biden still has support from many of his former administration colleagues.”Steyer aide out after swiping Harris volunteer data - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “A South Carolina aide for Tom Steyer’s 2020 presidential campaign stole valuable volunteer data collected by Kamala Harris’ campaign using an account from when he worked with the S.C. Democratic Party, according to multiple state and national party officials. The Steyer campaign said that it does not have possession of the data and that Democratic officials were only aware of the download, which they said was inadvertent, because they proactively notified them. Both the Democratic National Committee and S.C. Democratic Party denied that. The Democratic National Committee said they quickly caught the attempt on Friday by Steyer’s deputy S.C. state director Dwane Sims to export Harris’ data, which contained thousands of volunteer contacts collected over the course of the campaign in this critical early-voting primary state.”Nathan Gonzales: A year out, here's four scenarios for 2020 elections - Roll Call: “Even though predicting anything to do with Trump might seem like a risk because of how typically damaging stories don’t seem to impact his standing, the president is a historically unpopular figure whose job approval rating has been static for months. … Trump remains incredibly popular with the Republican base, however, and the GOP has transitioned to primarily embracing a person more than a conservative ideology. That could eventually create a messy transition of power, but for now, it gives the president a high electoral floor as Republicans rally to his cause. … Following are four scenarios, in order of their likelihood: Scenario 1: Eviction at 1600 … Scenario 2: Blue Washington … Scenario 3: Status Quo … Scenario 4: Red Revival.”  KEY WITNESS REVERSES TESTIMONY, ADMITS QUID PRO QUONYT: “A critical witness in the impeachment inquiry offered Congress substantial new testimony this week, revealing that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country likely would not receive American military aid unless it publicly committed to investigations President Trump wanted. The disclosure from Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in four new pages of sworn testimony released on Tuesday, confirmed his involvement in essentially laying out a quid pro quo to Ukraine that he had previously not acknowledged. The testimony offered several major new details beyond the account he gave the inquiry in a 10-hour interview last month. Mr. Sondland provided a more robust description of his own role in alerting the Ukrainians that they needed to go along with investigative requests being demanded by the president’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.”Transcripts suggest GOP lacks impeachment strategy - WaPo: “Republicans have complained for weeks about the secret House impeachment inquiry… But inside the secure room in the Capitol basement where the proceedings are taking place, Republicans have used their time to complain that testimony has become public, going after their colleagues who were quoted in media reports commenting on witness appearances, and quizzing witnesses themselves on how their statements had been released. The efforts by GOP lawmakers to shape the Democrats’ inquiry emerged in full view for the first time Monday with the release of hundreds of pages of transcripts from two early witnesses: Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. … But the newly released transcripts from Yovanovitch and McKinley — who appeared on Oct. 11 and Oct. 16, respectively — underscore how the Republicans’ strategy at that relatively early stage in the deposition process was more scattershot, covering a range of topics.”PLAY-BY-PLAYUnited States begins process of withdrawing from Paris climate deal - Fox NewsRNC paid $60,000 for Trump and entourage to watch cage-fighting - WaPoCalifornia drives out conservatives to ‘redder pastures’ - LATRep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., faces ethics probe over financial disclosure - PoliticoAUDIBLE: LIKE VERDUN, BUT FOR POLITICS

“I’m a huge Fox News fan. Why did Fox use 19% more Democrats in its poll than Republicans. I saw the break down at a conservative web site. Am I wrong?” – Dick Alexander, Pickerington, Ohio
[Ed. note: Somebody sold you a bum steer, I’m afraid, Mr. Alexander. In our most recent poll, 49 percent of respondents identified themselves as Democrats, 41 percent identified themselves as Republicans and 11 percent identified themselves as independents. Our numbers for both parties are higher than in other polls because our questionnaire gives respondents of being strong partisans, weak partisans or independents. Others, like this week’s WaPo/ABC News poll, force subjects to choose among just three options. But the result is about the same: a six-point edge for Democrats. In the WSJ/NBC News poll out this week, pollsters gave respondents seven (!) options on a partisanship scale, but the net effect is the same: Republicans trailed Democrats by 8 points. Those advantages for Democrats have been pretty consistent in recent years and over the history of public opinion polling. Certainly exit polls and our Fox News Voter Analysis consistently show that Democrats outnumber Republicans in elections. That’s why Republicans rely so much on independent and loosely affiliated voters to win elections. If the GOP starts doing better going into 2020, I would expect to see more independents expressing solidarity for the Red Team. But we’ll continue to track partisan affiliation in part because it provides valuable insight on how persuadable voters are moving. And you never need to trust the dubious analysis of others for whose being surveyed for our polls. We publish all the results for everyone to see.]
“I am hoping that someday people will stop calling the Democrat Party the ‘Democratic’ Party.” – Jim King, Chesapeake, Va.
[Ed. note: I’m always a little mystified about why so many Republicans harp on this subject. I never hear Democrats say that the other side should be called the Republic Party. As far as I can tell, the values of the Democratic Party are in line with the name. The party is generally (and increasingly) opposed to many limits on democracy. The Electoral College, disproportionate Senate representation, lifetime Supreme Court appointments and other small-r republican institutions are quite unpopular among progressives. More direct democracy, including low-to-zero barrier to ballot access, seems to be a top goal for many in the party. I also see some anti-republican trends among Republicans, particularly as it relates to a disregard bordering on disdain for the power of the legislative branch and a monarchical bent toward presidential power. But I think, generally, the parties are still in the respective lanes suggested by their names. But most of all, why wouldn’t you call people by the name they prefer? That just seems like good manners. And I certainly don’t know how you would ever bring someone around to your point of view on any subject if you start out with what is essentially an insult.]    
“In the article about the President’s taxes, it states that the NY state prosecutors are investigating the hush money payments made to two women.  What is the difference between those payments and NDA’s that many corporations use to prevent women from talking? Just wondering.” – Phillip H. Nawrocki, Mesa, Ariz.
[Ed. note: It’s legal to pay people to be quiet. But if you pay people to be quiet for the purposes of winning an election, you have to disclose that as a campaign expense. The problem for prosecutors in New York is that it will be extremely hard to prove that’s why Trump paid the hush money. As his lawyers have argued in the past, he had ample reasons to cover up his relationships with a sex worker and a nude model – hush money he would have paid whether he was running for office or not. There are some additional considerations about hiding income, etc., but it still seems like a tough case to make. It shouldn’t be hard to convince a jury that a man would pay money to keep the knowledge hidden that he was having sex with a pornographic performer while his wife was convalescing from childbirth.

House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump have requested that acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appear before the panels for a deposition on Friday, claiming that he was “directly involved” in the Ukraine controversy which sparked the proceedings.
House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel penned a letter to Mulvaney on Tuesday, requesting his appearance at a deposition as part of the impeachment inquiry this Friday at 9 a.m.
NEW DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED
“Based on evidence gathered in the impeachment inquiry and public reporting, we believe that you possess substantial first-hand knowledge and information relevant to the House’s impeachment inquiry,” they wrote.
“Specifically, the investigation has revealed that you may have been directly involved in an effort orchestrated by President Trump, his personal agent, Rudolph Giuliani, and others to withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trump’s personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so,” they continued.
The request for Mulvaney’s deposition comes amid the House’s formal impeachment inquiry into the president. The inquiry was opened in September after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.
A transcript released by the White House shows Trump making that request, but he and his allies deny that military aid was clearly linked to the request or that there was any ""quid pro quo."" Some witnesses coming before House committees as part of the impeachment proceedings have challenged that assertion.
In the letter, Schiff, D-Calif., Maloney, D-N.Y., and Engel, D-N.Y., referenced “evidence,” such as comments made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton regarding Mulvaney’s role in Trump’s conversations with Zelensky.
“…Bolton told a National Security Council staffer ‘to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. [Gordon] Sondland, Mr. Giuliani, and Mick Mulvaney’  to pressure Ukraine for political help,” they wrote.
“Ambassador Bolton, who appears to have believed that you were directly involved in the President’s scheme, reportedly instructed the NSC staffer to tell the NSC lawyers, ‘I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,’” they wrote. “The ‘drug deal’ appears to be a reference to the scheme to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations for the political benefit of President Trump.”
The chairs also accused Mulvaney of playing “a central role” in the president’s move to withhold military aid from Ukraine, and criticized him for his response to questions about the funds during a press conference at the White House last month.
“You admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the hold on Ukraine security assistance to further the President’s own personal, political interests, rather than national interest,” they wrote.
During a press conference on Oct. 17, Mulvaney was asked why Trump ordered the hold on military aid. The White House’s position has consistently been that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo with regard to the aid. But during that appearance, Mulvaney seemed to depart from his talking points.
“We do that all the time with foreign policy,” Mulvaney said. “And I have news for everybody: Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.”
Mulvaney, for days, tried to walk back his statement, after critics claimed he acknowledged a ""quid pro quo,"" but the chairs blasted his efforts Tuesday.
“Despite your subsequent attempts to walk-back this clear admission, your statements to the American public on October 17 were nothing less than a televised confession that President Trump’s order to freeze Ukraine security assistance was explicitly linked to Ukraine pursuing investigations as part of an effort to bolster the President’s 2020 re-election campaign,” they wrote.
It is unclear, at this point, whether Mulvaney will appear before the committees on Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, according to transcripts released Tuesday, pushed back on the claim that President Trump sought to withhold a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Kiev committed to investigate allegations concerning the 2016 election -- while also denying that Trump was seeking “dirt” on former Vice President Joe Biden.
The deposition transcripts, though, also reflect officials' concerns about the involvement of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in seeking politically related investigations out of Ukraine. Further, they offer varying accounts of whether a quid pro quo of some kind -- involving either a meeting or the release of U.S. military aid -- may have been presented.
One of the most significant revelations from Tuesday's release is that E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement -- a revelation that was quickly hailed by Democrats of proof of the quid pro quo they have been alleging took place.
Other sections presented a muddier picture. In the transcript of his closed-door deposition last month with lawmakers conducting the impeachment probe, Volker was asked if Trump withheld or delayed a meeting with Zelensky absent a pledge to probe concerns Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

“The answer to the question is no, if you want a yes-or-no answer. But the reason the answer is no is we did have difficulty scheduling a meeting, but there was no linkage like that,” he said.
Recently revealed text messages showed Volker appearing to link the investigations to a D.C. visit by Zelensky. The deposition transcript seems to reflect Volker asserting the contrary. Sondland, too, testifying about a conversation he had with White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, said he didn't tell him the investigations were needed in order for there to be a White House visit.
""That was never linked,"" he said. ""That was only specifically brought into the press statement for a brief period of time through Mr. Giuliani when we were negotiating a press statement.""
At another point in the transcript, though, Sondland said he eventually thought ""there might be a link between the White House visit and aid to the Ukraine that was being held up.""
House Democrats established the impeachment inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged him to “look into” allegations surrounding the 2016 election and the Biden family’s activities in the country. Democrats have alleged that a quid pro quo took place, with Trump leveraging military aid until the Ukrainians investigated the claims. Trump and Zelensky have claimed that no pressure was placed on them, but statements from certain officials have challenged that narrative.
While the White House released the transcript of the call, and a House committee released the original complaint by the whistleblower that sparked the process, much of the inquiry is now focusing on what officials understood to be the president’s intent at the time. While military aid was initially locked, it was eventually unblocked by Congress.
Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor recently testified that he understood the White House was willing to hold up both military aid and a prospective White House meeting to extract a public announcement from the country that probes were underway.
US ENVOY SONDLAND WORKED WITH GIULIANI ON UKRAINE CORRUPTION STATEMENT, VOLKER TESTIFIED: SOURCES
“By mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,” Taylor testified, referring to Burisma Holdings -- a Ukrainian energy firm where Joe Biden’s son Hunter sat on the board. A transcript of the July call shows Trump sought an investigation concerning Joe Biden’s involvement in seeking the ouster of a prosecutor looking into that firm.
Yet while Sondland had texted Taylor in September saying there was no quid pro quo, the transcripts released Tuesday of his deposition include a supplemental declaration, in which he says that “by the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.”
He also acknowledged telling one of Zelensky’s advisers that “resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.”
In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham still said the transcripts show less evidence for the ""illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought."" She noted that Sondland said he ""presumed"" there was a link to the aid—""but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption.""
In another excerpt from the testimony, Sondland described how the discussions about a statement on corruption in general in Ukraine became more explicitly about Biden-Burisma as a ""continuum"" amid the involvement of Giuliani, who was pushing the Biden-Burisma agenda.
""It kept—it kept getting more insidious as [the] timeline went on, and back in July, it was all about just corruption,"" he said.
Separately he told lawmakers that Trump repeatedly urged Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to talk to Giuliani.
""He didn’t even -- he wasn’t even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying: 'Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,'"" he said.
Volker too spoke about Giuliani's involvement, telling lawmakers that ""the negative narrative about Ukraine which Mr. Giuliani was furthering was the problem.""
Democrats seized on the testimony as proof of a quid pro quo, saying it was a sign that ""the president's scheme comes into clearer focus.""
“It is clear from their testimony that, in exchange for the statement, President Trump would award the Ukrainian president with a highly coveted White House meeting and, later, with millions of dollars in critical military aid being withheld,"" the statement from the chairs of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees said. ""Ambassador Sondland called this changing U.S. policy toward Ukraine a ‘continuum’ that became ever more ‘insidious’ over time.""
DIPLOMAT BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES TRUMP USED UKRAINE AID, WHITE HOUSE MEETING AS LEVERAGE FOR PROBES
The statement from Sondland contrasts with his texts with Taylor, who had expressed concern about what he saw as a quid pro quo.
""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,"" Taylor said in a text exchange in September.
“The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind,” Sondland texted back. “The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.”
Sondland, though, explained to the committees that Trump said something similar to him during a phone call, in which he said Trump was in a ""bad mood"" and nearly hung up on him.
""I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo,"" Trump said, according to Sondland. ""I want Zelensky to do the right thing.""
Volker, meanwhile, on the morning of a planned July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, seemed to link a White House visit with the investigations, despite his more recent testimony. He texted a Zelensky aide: ""Heard from White House -- Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.""
In his testimony, Volker was also asked if he would say that Trump asked Zelensky to “manufacture dirt on the Bidens.”
“No,” he said. “And I’ve seen that phrase thrown around a lot. And I think there’s a difference between the manufacture or dig up dirt versus finding out did anything happen in the 2016 campaign or did anything happen with Burisma. I think – or even if he's asking them to investigate the Bidens, it is to find out what facts there may be rather than to manufacture something.”
On the question of the hold placed on aid, he said it struck him as ""unusual"" but that ""no reason was ever given as to why that was.""

When Volker testified last month, Republicans said his testimony did not comport with what they called “Democrats’ impeachment narrative.”
Meanwhile, two witnesses were scheduled to give depositions on Tuesday, but didn’t show up to the House Intelligence Committee. They are Michael Duffey, an associate director for National Security Programs at the office of Management and Budget, and Wells Griffith, director of international energy and environment at the National Security Council.

With several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees could soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench.
President Trump is on his way to reaching a significant mark in his presidency, as his latest nominees for federal appeals courts go through the confirmation process.
With several potential appeals judges awaiting confirmation, Trump's nominees could soon make up more than a quarter of those serving on the appellate bench. Out of 179 Circuit Court positions, 43 are occupied by Trump picks, with four current vacancies and another five spots opening up due to upcoming retirements.
TRUMP JUDICIAL PICK BREAKS DOWN IN TEARS AT HEARING OVER LEGAL GROUP’S ATTACK
“This is an exciting milestone for the president,” Judicial Crisis Network policy director Carrie Severino told Fox News.
While a number of Trump’s picks are filling seats previously held by judges appointed by Republican presidents, many are taking the place of liberal jurists appointed by Democrats. The Ninth Circuit, for example, once known as a staunchly liberal Court of Appeals, is gradually evening out. Trump has already placed six judges on the Ninth Circuit bench, which currently has one vacancy and will have two more in the near future.
Should Trump fill all three spots, he will have chosen nearly a third of the roster with nine out of 29 judges.
Severino described Trump’s appellate nominees as “exceptional,” while stressing their independence.
“That’s the kind of judge America wants,” Severino said, claiming that the ability to select judges for lifetime positions is a significant part of why Trump was elected in 2016.
TRUMP NOMINATES WAVE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES, IN FRESH BID TO RESHAPE COURTS
Democrats have been fierce in their opposition to several of Trump’s selections. Steven Menashi, who was nominated to the Second Circuit, was grilled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over his past writings and his work with the White House counsel’s office. A segment on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show discussed a law journal article Menashi wrote in 2010, titled ""Ethnonationalism and Liberal Democracy."" Maddow cited Menashi’s use of the term “ethnonationalism” to suggest he is aligned with white nationalists, alleging he's on the “fringe of racial thinking.”
During questioning, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that Menashi had faced “unusually personal” and “vicious” attacks.
Menashi denied the allegations, saying, “It’s hurtful and I think it misrepresents what I’ve written.”
During his hearing, Menashi made it clear that his article was about Israel and how the Jewish state is not out of the norm, because there is a precedent for democratic countries to have a common ethnicity. He said he was not proposing the U.S. should have an ethnically homogeneous society, but noted that U.S. citizens do have a shared identity based on “constitutional traditions.""
Menashi also drew criticism from members of both parties when he would not discuss his White House work, leading Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to lose his temper, saying it was ""inappropriate"" for him to even seek the nomination if he would not answer questions.
The American Bar Association (ABA), which evaluates federal judicial nominees, rated Menashi as “Well Qualified,” its highest mark.
The ABA’s rating system was called into question by Republicans, however, after they issued a scathing letter with a “Not Qualified” rating of Lawrence VanDyke, who was nominated for an upcoming vacancy on the Ninth Circuit.
The ABA’s letter cited concerns from unnamed individuals the group interviewed, suggesting that he would not be fair to LGBTQ litigants and that he lacked the proper temperament, knowledge, and work ethic for the role. Republicans accused the ABA of conducting a biased evaluation, as the lead evaluator who conducted interviews once contributed to the campaign of someone who had run against VanDyke for a judicial position.
Additionally, multiple people who were interviewed by the ABA for VanDyke’s evaluation told Fox News that they gave positive reviews and were surprised by the ABA’s findings.
Addressing the accusations in the ABA’s letter, specifically his supposed stance towards the LGBTQ community, VanDyke broke down in tears in the middle of his hearing, denying the allegation.
“No, I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God. They should all be treated with dignity and respect,” he said.
Despite opposition from the left, Trump’s picks are likely to be confirmed due to the Senate’s Republican majority.

Mike Davis, president of The Article III Project, which works to help secure the confirmation of Trump’s picks, noted that the president’s success in this area fulfills one of his 2016 campaign promises.
“President Trump has delivered on his promise to American voters,” Davis said, pointing to Trump’s appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, “and an all-time-record number of circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals.”

Dr. Vin Gupta weighs in.
As ""Medicare-for-all"" dominates the debate in America's Democratic presidential primary, a new report released by the British government on its National Health Service, or NHS, offers a warning on the downsides of a single-payer system.
The report on the government-run NHS system in England, released last month, details increased wait times for services ranging from emergency room visits to cancer care. And the study reports historic waiting lists totaling over 4.5 million people, up 40 percent in five years, for treatment with specialists.
""Cancer waiting times are the worst on record,"" the report also declares.
An American ""Medicare-for-all"" system would be different in a number of ways from the U.K.'s NHS system. Most notably, in Britain, the doctors and nurses are government-paid employees, and institutions are mostly government-run, while the ""Medicare-for-all"" plans in play would essentially put the government in charge of paying for privately run health care.
But the NHS has long been hailed as a successful example of government-run health care by a range of Democrats and left-wing activists. The single-payer health care plans boosted by top Democratic 2020 contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have captured attention in recent days after Warren released her long-awaited plan last week.
Critics in the United States have said that Warren's price-control proposals could lead to shortages similar to those in England.
""Amusingly, she also proposes savings from 'restoring health care competition,'"" The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Sunday. ""Because everyone will have good insurance, she says, 'providers will have to compete on better care and reduced wait times in order to attract more patients.' But if government is controlling all prices and reimbursements, what incentive is there to compete at all?
""There’s a reason every government-run health system in the world rations care. Ms. Warren won’t admit this explicitly about her brave new health world, but she comes close.""
The report on the NHS system in England, released last month, finds that its performance is not meeting its standards in multiple statistical categories. For example, in September of this year, 15 percent of emergency room patients experienced wait times of more than four hours before admission or discharge. The system's stated goal is to keep that number at 5 percent. Additionally, wait times for cancer treatment are the worst on record and waiting lists for consultant-led treatment are at their highest ever.
""In August 2019, 78.5% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent [general practitioner] referral,"" the report says of cancer wait times. ""During 2018 and 2019 record low performance against this target was recorded. The target of 85% has been missed for all but one month since April 2014.""

      A chart from the British House of Commons shows increased wait times for ""accident and emergency"" care in English hospitals over time.

WARREN UNDER FIRE ON 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' AS SHE NOW CLAIMS BILLIONAIRES ALONE CAN FUND IT
Patients whose general practitioner refers them to a consultant, the report continues, are also waiting longer.
While the report is largely negative, it notes some positive indicators -- including an increase in the number of doctors and nurses in recent years.
The British NHS provides health care for all for no cost at the point of delivery, which is similar to what Sanders and Warren aim for with ""Medicare-for-all."" It is funded through general taxation, meaning every taxpayer chips in to fund the program.

Kamala Harris of California.,"2020 Democratic hopefuls focus on the economy as President Trump touts new economic numbers.
An aide in South Carolina for 2020 Democratic presidential primary hopeful Tom Steyer has resigned after it was discovered that he stole volunteer data from the campaign of rival candidate Sen. Kamala Harris of California.
Steyer’s campaign confirmed on Monday evening that Dwane Sims, the billionaire candidate’s deputy South Carolina state director, offered his resignation following an internal investigation into the allegations that he stole the data of thousands of contacts from the Harris campaign. 
“Last week, the South Carolina Democratic Party turned off voter file access to the Steyer campaign for a short period of time. When it was reinstated, Dwane Sims, a former South Carolina Democratic Party employee, had access to other presidential campaign data,” Heather Hargreaves, Steyer’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “When we first learned about the matter, we conducted an internal investigation and wiped Mr. Sims’ computer to make sure the data was completely deleted and that there was no access to other campaign data.”
DAVID AVELLA: TOM STEYER IS BIDEN'S BIGGEST THREAT
She added: “We understand the sensitivity and importance of this information. We apologize to the South Carolina Democratic Party and the DNC. Tom Steyer and the Steyer campaign extend our deepest apology to Senator Kamala Harris and her campaign.”
The Steyer campaign noted that the South Carolina Democratic Party had turned off access for a short time last week to voter files and when it was reinstated Sims – as a former employee of the state party – had access to information on other presidential candidates' data. Sims called the SCDP “[w]ithin minutes of realizing this” and access was disabled, according to Steyer’s campaign.
But in a story first reported by The Post and Courier of Charleston, officials from the SCDP and the Democratic National Committee said they actually intervened in Sims' attempt to export the data, which included thousands of voter contacts built up by Harris' campaign.
""Our organizers and volunteers work incredibly hard, and as this story notes, our campaign ‘has built a particularly extensive field organizing operation in South Carolina,’” Ian Sams, the Harris campaign’s national press secretary, said in a tweet. “It's unfortunate anyone would try to steal that work from our team.""

Sims was announced last month as Steyer's deputy state director in South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South. A month earlier, Sims had been working as data director for the South Carolina Democratic Party, a role in which he had access to proprietary campaign information.
A recent poll by The Post and Courier has Steyer polling at 5 percent, compared with Harris at 11 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden still holds a commanding lead in Palmetto State with 30 percent.

MANCHESTER, N.H. – Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro is laying off his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two of the first four early-voting states in the primary and caucus nominating season.
The former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing secretary in then-President Barack Obama’s cabinet will now focus his campaign on Iowa, which kicks off the nominating calendar, and Nevada, which votes third. The news – first reported by Politico – was confirmed early Tuesday by Fox News with a source close to the Castro campaign. The small staffs in both New Hampshire and South Carolina were notified on Monday.
CASTRO REACHES FUNDRAISING GOAL, STAYING IN 2020 RACE
The move by the Castro campaign comes just a few days after it announced on Friday that it brought in $800,000 in the last 10 days of October, a haul Castro had said was necessary to continue his uphill bid for the Democratic nomination.
But reaching that goal didn’t erase the steep fundraising hurdles facing the campaign. Castro, who launched his longshot bid last December, has frequently spotlighted his underdog status as he runs for the nomination against many much better-known and better-funded rivals.
Castro made the stage for the first four rounds of Democratic presidential primary debates, but has yet to qualify for the fifth round, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia. The candidate has reached the individual donor threshold but remains short of reaching the polling criteria.
In a fundraising email on Monday, Castro campaign officials warned that their candidate was in jeopardy of not making the debate stage and said that they were “launching IMMEDIATE digital ads” to help them clinch “the final polls Julian needs to qualify.”
THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
Castro, the only Latino among the major Democratic White House hopefuls, will now pour his remaining resources into Iowa – where he launches a five-figure ad buy on Tuesday – and Nevada. He’ll also concentrate on his native Texas, which votes on Super Tuesday, directly after the early voting states. The other Texan in the nomination race, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, ended his White House bid on Friday. 
Castro raised roughly $3.5 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, but spent nearly $4 million in the same period. Castro has just $670,000 cash on hand at the start of October, but raised $1 million last month.

Eyebrows were raised in New Hampshire in recent days as Castro’s campaign had yet to schedule a date for their candidate to file in person to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. The source close to the campaign said it was unclear if Castro would file in person.
KAMALA HARRIS LAYS OFF STAFF, SHUTS OFFICES, IN NH
The move by Castro follows a similar step made last week by Sen. Kamala Harris. The California Democrat, hemorrhaging campaign cash, dramatically cut her staff in New Hampshire and closed all of her field offices in the first primary state, as she continues to concentrate all of her resources on Iowa.

President Trump on Tuesday offered U.S. assistance as he called on Mexico to “wage war” against the country's murderous drug cartel “monsters” in response to the brutal killing of multiple Americans a day earlier.
“If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively,” Trump tweeted. “The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!”
US CITIZENS KILLED, KIDNAPPED IN CARTEL SHOOTING IN MEXICO
Officials say at least six children and three women, apparently all U.S. citizens living in a community of Americans in Mexico, were gunned down after their convoy came under fire during a daylight ambush Monday. Six children were found alive, five of whom have been taken to hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. One child is currently missing, and authorities are searching the mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border for the child.
Those attacked were members of the LeBaron family, a well-known American clan who has lived in the community in the northern part of the country for decades, according to The New York Times. The attack targeted citizens who live in a community founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
""This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,"" Trump tweeted. ""We merely await a call from your great new president!""
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador refused that approach, however, saying at a Tuesday news conference, ""The worst thing you can have is war.""
""We declared war, and it didn't work,"" Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. ""That is not an option.""
Trump has repeatedly raised concerns about levels of gang violence and drug-related crime in Mexico, particularly as it relates to securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The two countries have stepped up cooperation on that front over the summer, with asylum seekers being returned to Mexico to await hearings, while Mexico has also increased its troop presence on both its northern and southern borders.

Early reports indicated the tragedy could have been a case of mistaken identity, but recent history also raises the possibility the LeBaron family was the intended target: only a decade ago, two members of the family opposed to local drug trafficking groups were kidnapped and murdered, according to the New York Times.
Mexico's federal Department of Security and Citizens' Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area following ""the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people."" The troops were searching for the missing community members, believed to include 11 children or more.
A number of Republicans backed Trump's call for action in Mexico in response to the massacre. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said that Mexico is ""dangerously close to being a failed state.""
""This is what happens when Mexico’s politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power. Enough. Mexico’s president hasn’t taken the threat seriously and innocent American lives have been lost again. The Mexican government must partner with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to wage a full-scale offensive against these butchers,” he said.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose own father was born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, also extended his condolences for the victims and called for the U.S. to get involved.
“Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence,” he tweeted.
